<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In the Preface to the &ldquo;Handbook of Art Needlework,&rdquo;
which I edited for the Royal School at South Kensington
in 1880, I undertook to write a second part, to be devoted
to design, colour, and the common-sense modes of treating
decorative art, as applied especially to embroidered
hangings, furniture, dress, and the smaller objects of
luxury.</p>

<p>Circumstances have, since then, obliged me to reconsider
this intention; and I have found it more practicable
to cast the information which I have collected from
Eastern and Western sources into the form of a separate
work, which in no way supersedes or interferes with the
technical instruction supposed to be conveyed in a handbook.
I have found so much amusement in learning
for myself the history of the art of embroidery, and in
tracing the beginnings and the interchanges of national
schools, that I cannot but hope that I may excite a
similar interest in some of my readers, and so induce
those who are capable, to help and lift it to a higher
place than it has been allowed in these latter days to
occupy. If I have given too important a position to
the art of needlework, I would observe that while I have
been writing, decorative embroidery has come to the front,
and is at this moment one of the hobbies of the day;
and I would point out that it contains in itself all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
necessary elements of art; it may exercise the imagination
and the fancy; it needs education in form, colour,
and composition, as well as the craft of a practised hand,
to express its language and perfect its beauty.</p>

<p>I confess that when I undertook this task, I did not
anticipate the time I have had to spend in collecting
and epitomizing the many notices to be found in German,
French, and English authors, on what has been considered
among us, at least in this century, as merely a
secondary art, and therefore, as such, of little importance.
Cursory notices of needlework are scattered through
almost every book on art; and under the head of textiles
it is usual to find embroidery acknowledged as being
worthy of notice, though not to be named in company
with sculpture, architecture, or painting, however beautifully
or thoughtfully its works may be carried out. I
have tried to show that it deserves higher estimation.</p>

<p>My first intention was simply to consider <span class="smcap">Style</span>, good
or bad, as it influences our embroidery of to-day, and to
find some rules by which to guide that of the future in
its next phase. But when we search into the fluctuations
of style, and their causes, we find they have an historical
succession, and that we must begin at the beginning and
trace them through the life of mankind.</p>

<p>This led me to attempt a sketch of consecutive styles,
their overlap and variations.</p>

<p>I then found that <span class="smcap">Design</span>, <span class="smcap">Patterns</span>, <span class="smcap">Stitches</span>,
<span class="smcap">Materials</span>, each require a separate study.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colour</span>, as applied to dyes, claims to be regarded as
differing from pigments on the painter&rsquo;s palette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hangings</span>, <span class="smcap">Dress</span>, and <span class="smcap">Ecclesiastical Embroideries</span>
each require different rules, and the study of the best
examples of past centuries. Finally, it seems natural
to dwell on our own proficiency in decorative work.
<span class="smcap">English Embroidery</span> has always excelled; and, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>ix]</a></span>
have again returned to this occupation, it is worth while
to recollect what we have done of old.</p>

<p>In writing chapters on these subjects, I have found it
most convenient to separate the historical and &aelig;sthetic
questions from the technical rules, and the instruction
which naturally belongs to a handbook, of which the
purpose should be to teach the easiest and most orthodox
manner of executing the simplest, and elaborating the
finest works. Such questions ought not to be overlaid
with arch&aelig;ological inquiries, or with the information
which only profits the designer; though of course it is
best that the knowledge of design should be part of the
education of the craft.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may be found to have written a book too
shallow for the learned, too deep for the frivolous, too
technical for the general public, and too diffuse for the
specialist of the craft.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>I must deprecate these criticisms by saying that I have
written it for the benefit of those who know nothing of
the art, and are too much engaged to seek information
here and there; who yet, being women, have to select
and to execute ornamental needlework; or, being artists,
are vexed at the incongruities and want of intention in
the decorations in daily domestic use; I have also
sought to help the designer, that he or she may know
something of the history of patterns and stitches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>x]</a></span>
If my readers should be aware of repetitions, they must
forgive them; remembering that the same idea has to
be looked at sometimes from a different point of view,
according to the use to which it is to be fitted. The
same material may be employed for wall-hangings and
dress, and then the principles which have been formulated
have to be varied. I do not shrink from repetitions if
they make my meaning clear, remembering the Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s direction to his private secretary, &ldquo;Never
mind repetitions; and <em>dot</em> your i&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Portions of these chapters have been already published
in No. 49 of the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in 1881; and more
was delivered in three unpublished lectures the same
year.</p>

<p>I have acknowledged and noted on each page my
authorities for the facts I have quoted. The illustrations
that are not original, have been copied from other works
by permission of authors and publishers. To all of these
I wish to express my obligations and thanks, especially
to Mr. Villiers Stuart, Dr. Anderson, Sir G. Birdwood,
and Sir H. Layard, for their courtesy in allowing me
the use of their plates. To my old and valued friend,
Mr. Newton, I wish to express my gratitude for his
unstinted gifts of time and trouble, bestowed in criticizing
and correcting my book, encouraging me to give it to
the public, and making it more worthy of publication.</p>

<p>I have largely quoted Charles Blanc (&ldquo;Ornament in
Dress,&rdquo; English translation), Von Bock (&ldquo;Liturgische
Gew&auml;nder&rdquo;), Dr. Rock (&ldquo;The Church of our Fathers&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Introduction to Textiles&rdquo;), Semper (&ldquo;Der Stil&rdquo;),
Yates (&ldquo;Textrinum Antiquorum&rdquo;), and Yule (&ldquo;Marco
Polo&rdquo;), besides many others. But these authorities
often differ, and, after weighing their arguments, I have
ventured to select for my use the facts and theories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xi]</a></span>
which accord with my own views. Facts are often so
interdependent and closely linked, that it requires great
care to distinguish where they have been shaped or
coloured (however unintentionally) to fit each other or
the writer&rsquo;s preconceived ideas. Certain it is that facts
are but useless heaps till the thread of a theory is found
on which to hang them. This process, like that of
stringing pearls, has to be often repeated, till each occupies
its right place. Only those who have adopted and
cherished a theory can appreciate the pain of cutting the
thread, to displace what appeared to be a pearl, but which,
from its false position as to date or place, or its doubtful
origin, has proved only an empty manufactured glass
bead of error.</p>

<p>This has happened to me more than once; and since
I read my lectures I have had to change my opinions
in several instances. If, therefore, any of my readers
should observe such changes, I hope they will give me
credit for trying to convey <em>now</em> what appears to me on
each subject a correct impression.</p>

Besides the art, I have sought to give something of the arch&aelig;ology
of needlework. Now the qualifications for being a teacher on such
subjects are rarely to be met with, all combined. Mr. Newton, in his
&ldquo;Essays on Art and Arch&aelig;ology,&rdquo; p. 37, says that &ldquo;the arch&aelig;ologist
should combine with the &aelig;sthetic culture of the artist, and the trained
judgment of the historian and the philologist, that critical acumen,
required for classification and interpretation; nor should that habitual
suspicion which must ever attend the scrutiny and precede the warranty
of evidence, give too sceptical a bias to his mind.&rdquo; Such
authorities have been interrogated on each part of my subject.</p>

<h1 class="padtop">NEEDLEWORK AS ART.</h1>



<h2 class="padtop">INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The book of the Science of Art has yet to be written.
Art has been called the Flower of Life, and also the
Consoler;&mdash;adorning the existence of the strong and
bright,&mdash;sheltering and comforting the sad and solitary
ones of the earth. But, rather, it resembles a wide-spreading
tree, covered with varied blossoms&mdash;bearing
many fruits.</p>

<p>To point out the history and the possibilities in the
future of each branch that shades, refreshes, and gives
wholesome fruit to the world, would be a task worthy of
a master-hand and a pen of gold. But less ambitious
labourers in the field of investigation which is only as
yet partly cultivated, may each assist, by carefully
collecting a little heap of ascertained facts; and it is,
indeed, the duty of each as he passes to add his pebble
to the slowly accumulating cairn of recorded human
knowledge.</p>

<p>Some one has said, &ldquo;Build your house of little bricks
of facts, and you will soon find it inhabited by a body of
truth; and that truth will ally itself with other houses of
facts, and in time a well-ordered, cosmical city will arise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My pebble is not yet polished. It is neither a diamond
nor a ruby, but I think there are a few streaks of golden
light in it, which I may venture to add to the daily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
accumulating treasure in the house of human artistic
knowledge.</p>

<p>My object in writing this volume is to fill up an empty
space in the English library of art.</p>

<p>The great exponents of poetic thought&mdash;verse, sculpture,
painting, and architecture&mdash;have long since been well
interpreted and appreciated. Men and women have
written much and well on these large subjects, and we
may hope for more ere long. The secondary or smaller
arts have been hitherto neglected by us,&mdash;either treated
merely as crafts, to which artistic education may give
help, or as the natural or inferior outcome of the primal
arts, having no claim to the possession of special laws
and history. And yet, when Moses wrote and Homer
sang, needlework was no new thing. It was already
consecrated by legendary and traditionary custom to the
highest uses. The gods themselves were honoured by
its service, and it preceded written history in recording
heroic deeds and national triumphs.</p>

<p>It may be said that ivory carving is sculpture, and
illuminated manuscripts and coloured glass windows are
painting. But for metal work, whether in iron or gold, a
place must be kept apart; and the same privileges are due
to embroidery and to metallurgy. All arts must of necessity
have their own laws and rules, which ensure their beauty
of execution and their special forms of design; these two
last, from the nature of their materials, and the modes of
working them, must be studied independently of any
connection with painting, architecture, or sculpture.</p>

<p>Yet, if the unity of nature is an accepted fact,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> then
the acceptance of the unity of art must follow. Art
must be considered as the selection of natural phenomena
by individual minds capable of assimilating and reproducing
them in certain forms and with certain materials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
adapted to the national taste, needs, and power of
appreciation. If man cannot originate materials, he can
invent combinations;&mdash;and this is Art.</p>

<p>If proportion, colour, and sound alike depend on
certain mathematical measurements, and on rhythmical
vibrations, there must be a real and tangible relation
between these elements, though applied to obtain
different results. In music, as in all art, harmony is, or
ought to be, a first consideration. We have seen by
experiment how a note of our scale can by touch form
geometrical figures with sand on a sheet of glass,&mdash;here
form obeys the force of harmony. But what is
harmony?</p>

<p>By analogy we may argue from the art of music.
We who believe that we have acquired the knowledge
of music as a science, beyond all preceding knowledge of
the subject, have in Europe been able to enjoy only our
own musical scales; whereas throughout the East, those
accepted by the human ear are very various, and appear
to depart from what to our senses is harmony. Those
Oriental musics have either been adapted to the Oriental
ear, or the ear has been adapted to appreciate the forms
and laws of harmony with which it came in contact.</p>

<p>The same questions occur to us while examining into
the different forms of decorative art; and we are constantly
reminded that the laws which should govern
them, are perhaps, infinitely larger and wider than we
with our limited human capacities and experience, have
hitherto been able to appreciate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ars longa&mdash;vita brevis&rdquo; has been so often said, that
from a proverb it has become a truism; but it must
continue to be the refrain of those who write upon art.
The subject is so long, and its ramifications are so
intricate, that it is difficult to include them all under
one category.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
My furthest aim here is to trace back the art of
needlework to its beginning, without turning my eyes to
the right or the left, though I cannot help feeling myself
drawn aside almost irresistibly by casual glimpses
of architecture, sculpture, and painting, which here and
there touch very nearly the history of needlework.</p>

<p>Except where they visibly influence each other, I
avoid dealing with the greater arts, leaving them to the
study of the learned in each special branch.</p>

<p>All art, however, throws reflected lights, and gleaning
in the track of those authors who have preceded us, we
often pick up valuable hints which we accept, and make
use of them gladly.</p>

<p>Some writers have thought it incumbent on them to
give a local habitation and an abiding place to needlework,
and they have regarded it as a branch of painting.
But I cannot endorse this classification. According to
Semper, indeed, it is the mother-art of sculpture and
painting, instead of being the offspring of either or both,
as others have maintained.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> They have, indeed, such
distinct functions that each may justly boast its own
original sources. Painting is the art of colour; sculpture
is that of form; embroidery is the art of clothing forms.
They are all so ancient, that in seeking to ascertain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
their beginnings and dates. It is difficult to fix the
precedence of one over another. We may compare,
distinguish, and yet again change our opinions as fresh
facts come under our observation.</p>

<p>The art of needlework reached its climax long ago,
and is now very old. History and faded rags are the
only witnesses to its fabulous glories, in Classical, Oriental,
and early Medi&aelig;val days. It would appear that nothing
new remains to be invented. Copies of past styles, and
selections from the scraps we retain and value as models,
are all that we can boast of now.</p>

<p>Dr. Rock truly says that few persons of the present
day have the faintest idea of the labour, the money, the
time, often bestowed of old upon embroideries which
had been designed as well as wrought by the hands of
men and women, each in their own craft the best and
ablest of their day.</p>

<p>Time is too short, our life too densely crowded, to
allow leisure for the extravagance of what is, after all,
only a luxury of art&mdash;no longer a civilizer, as of old,
but just an efflorescence of our culture.</p>

<p>Embroidery is now essentially &ldquo;decoration,&rdquo; and nothing
more. It is intended to appeal to the sense of beauty of
the eye, rather than to the imagination. The designer
for needlework should be an artist, but he need not be a
poet. You may omit this art altogether, and you need
be none the less sumptuously clothed and lodged. Yet
it is worthy of careful study as historical evidence, and
that in the present and future, as in the past, it may be
an <em>art</em>, and not merely a <em>craft</em>.</p>

<p>For the great web of history is composed of many
threads of divers colours, and the warp and the woof are
often exchanged, yet so connected and knotted together
that the continuity is never broken. On this web, Time
has drawn the picture of the past&mdash;sometimes faintly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
sometimes with indelible tints and pronounced forms.
By poetry; by architecture and its decorations; by dress,
which represents and distinguishes nationalities; by
customs, such as the different forms of burial; or even by
such details as painting the eyes; also by the tradition and
outcome of the laws of the tribes that flowed consecutively
over Europe from the East; by the institutions
which remained immutably fixed on their native soil,
such as those of the Code of Manu, and those of Babylon,
inscribed on bricks or clay; or by the words, their form
and lettering, in which these are handed down to us;&mdash;out
of all these the history of man is being reconstructed.</p>

<p>How valuable is every witness to the ancient records,
which were fading into myths in the memories of men.
How joyfully is each little fact hailed as a landmark, in
the general fog of doubt!</p>

<p>Now embroidery may boast that it is a source of landmarks
for all time.</p>

<p>Without presuming to fix a date for its first beginning,
that which I wish to impress on the mind of the reader
is the long continuity of the art of needlework.</p>

<p>The sense of antiquity induces reverence, and I
claim for the needle an older and more illustrious age
than can be accorded to the brush. While the great
pendulum of Time has swung art in sculpture, painting,
and architecture, from its cradle as in Mycen&aelig;, to its
throne in Athens in the days of Pericles, and then back
again to the basest poverty of decaying Rome&mdash;needle
work, continually refreshed from Eastern inspiration,
never has fallen so low, though it had never aspired as
high as its greater sister arts.</p>

<p>The stuffs and fabrics of various materials of the
Egyptians, Chinese, Assyrians, and Chaldeans are named
in the earliest records of the human race. How much
these decorations depended on weaving, and how much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
on embroidery with the needle, may in each case be
disputed. The products of the Babylonian looms are
alluded to in the Book of Joshua. Their beauty tempted
Achan to rescue them when Jericho fell;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and Ezekiel
speaks of the embroideries of Canneh, Haran, and
Eden, as well as of their cloths of purple and blue,
and their chests of garments of divers colours<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>All these fabrics are named as merchandise, and were
carried to the sea-coast, and thence over the ancient
world, by the Ph&oelig;nicians, the great shipowners and
dealers of the East.</p>

<p>Indian needlework and design is 4000 years old; and
the long perspective of Egyptian art, while leading us
still further back into unlimited periods, shows it changing
so slowly, that we feel as if it had been all but stationary
from the beginning.</p>

<p>The Chinese claim 5000 years as the life of their
history; but if, as is now suggested, their civilization is
Accadian or Proto-Babylonian, their wonderful artistic
and scientific knowledge may have been fragments of
the great dispersal, secreted and preserved behind the
wonderful wall<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of stone, silence, and law, where it has
lain fossilized ever since. One cannot but wonder at the
perfection of the textile manufactures of the Chinese,
their marvellous embroideries, and the peculiar modes
of construction and design throughout their arts, which
have shown but few moments of change in growth&mdash;scarcely
a sign of evolution. And we may fairly surmise
that this Accadian culture (if such it be) is reflected from
antediluvian tradition.</p>

<p>The arch&aelig;ology of Oriental art is most interesting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
We contemplate with awe the vast splendours of the
consecutive civilizations of the East; the ancient richness
and fertility of the whole of the Asiatic continent; the
genius for empire and for commerce; the creative power
which seemed to pour itself forth, unchecked by wars
and conquests; the great dynasties which rose and fell,
leaving behind them gigantic works, and the records of
fabulous luxury in the empires of China, Assyria, India,
and Persia, of which the remains have been of late years
excavated, deciphered, and confronted with the historical
texts which we have inherited, and had only partly
believed. And studying these new aspects of history,
we are saddened, thinking that the sunrise comes to us
from shining over desert sands or the mounds of empty
cities, where the lion and the jackal &ldquo;reassert their
primeval possession,&rdquo; or where the European and the
Tartar, from the West and from the East, dispute their
rights to suzerainty. We are dazzled and confused when
we look back to those great days when the over-peopled
kingdoms sent forth whole tribes, eastward to the confines
of Asia, southward over India, and westward over Europe;
and we bow reverently before the mighty Power that led
the Jews, by a promise and a hope, across the seething
nationalities, through the long passage of time from
Abraham to Solomon; and which is again giving into the
hands of those Oriental-looking men, so much power in
shaping the destiny of mankind through their great riches.</p>

<p>Moses commanded the Hebrew people to lend and
never to borrow. They have obeyed his precept, except
in art; to that they have lent or given nothing. There
is no national Jewish art. For music only do they show
artistic genius, and that is European and not Oriental.
As illustrating their lack of intuitive decorative art, one
need only refer to the architecture of the first, second,
and third Temple buildings, which apparently reflected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
Babylonian and Semitic influences on an early Chaldean
type. The embroideries mentioned by different writers,
from Moses to Josephus, appear to have had always a
Babylonian, or later a Persian inspiration.</p>

<p>This absence of artistic genius is very remarkable in a
people that had its origin in the Eastern centre from
whence all art has radiated.</p>

<p>The reason that so little survives of ancient embroidery
is evident. Woollen stuffs and threads decay quickly&mdash;the
moth and rust do corrupt them&mdash;and the very few
ancient bits that remain, have been preserved by the
embalming process, which has kept the contents of tombs
from becoming dust.</p>

<p>As to more modern embroideries, we ought to be
thankful that the art has had its fashions; otherwise, the
world would be overwhelmed with shabby rags. Human
nature has a tendency to dislike the &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo;&mdash;i.e.
the fashion of the last generation. That which our
mothers worked or wore, is an object for affectionate
sentiment, and the best specimens alone are preserved.
That which belonged to our grandfathers and grandmothers
has receded into the rococo; and a few more
generations take us back to the antique, of which so
little survives, from wear and tear, carelessness and theft,
that we put away and preserve it as being curious and
precious. We may hope that the general law of the survival
of the fittest has guarded what is most remarkable.</p>

<p>Certain works have been consecrated by the hands
that executed them, or by that of the donor, or by the
purpose for which they were bestowed, and are mostly
preserved in churches or national museums. Of these
there are vestments and altar decorations worked by
royal and noble ladies; and coronation garments given
by Queens and Empresses, such as Queen Gisela&rsquo;s and
the Empress Kunigunda&rsquo;s at Prague and Bamberg, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
Charlemagne&rsquo;s dalmatic at the Vatican, described in the
chapter on <a href="#Page_303">ecclesiastical embroideries</a>. Sculptured effigies
help us as to embroidered patterns; for our forefathers
often actually copied in bronze or stone the patterns of
the garments in which the body was buried, or at any
rate, those the man had worn in his life. Of these, King
John&rsquo;s monument at Worcester, and the surcoat of the
Black Prince at Canterbury, are remarkable examples.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The succeeding chapters will contain sketches of
the history of the different stitches, and of the best
examples of stitch and style remaining to us; and I
shall try to extract from both the best suggestions for
guidance in design and handicraft.</p>

<p>Embroidery from its nature is essentially the woman&rsquo;s
art.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It needs a sedentary life, industry and patience. It
does not require a room to itself, and the worker may leave
it at any moment between two stitches when called to
other duties. Nunneries produced the finest work of the
dark and middle ages; and their teaching inaugurated
the workrooms in the palaces and castles, where young
girls, whether royal, noble, or gentle, were trained in
embroidery as an accomplishment and a household duty.</p>

<p>The history of domestic embroidery ought to be looked
upon as that of an important factor in the humanizing effect of
&aelig;sthetic culture.</p>

<p>The woman of the house has always been strong
to fulfil her part in this civilizing influence with the
implement which custom has awarded to her. Every
man in the ancient East began his life under the tent or
in the palace adorned by the hands of his mother and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
maidens, and his home was made beautiful by his wife
and his sisters and their slaves. There, as in medi&aelig;val
homes, lessons of morality and religion, and the love and
fame of noble deeds, were taught by the painting of the
needle to the minds of the young men, who would have
scorned more direct teaching; and the children felt the
influence, as the women wove what the bards sang.</p>

<p>Alas! we have but few specimens of embroideries of
which we know the history, earlier than the tenth and
eleventh centuries.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Yet from the days of the books of
the Old Testament and the song of the siege of Troy,
down to the present time, the woman of the house has
adorned not only herself and her dear lord, but she has
hung the walls, the seats, the bed, and the tables with her
beautiful creations.</p>

Troy, all romantic and classical lore, provided subjects
for the needle.</p>

<p>Shakespeare gives a pretty picture of the graceful
weaver and embroiderer:&mdash;</p>

<p>Before closing this Introduction, I will take the
opportunity to protest against the abuse of the phrase
&ldquo;High Art.&rdquo; It is generally appropriated by that which
is the lowest and most feeble.</p>

<p>An old design for a chair or table, by no means remarkable
originally, but cheaply copied, and covered with
a quaint and dismal cretonne or poorly worked pattern,
of which the design is neither new nor artistic, is introduced
by the upholsterer as belonging to &ldquo;High Art
furniture.&rdquo; The epithet has succeeded to what was once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
&ldquo;fashionable&rdquo; and &ldquo;elegant.&rdquo; To get rid of carpets,
and put down rugs, to hang up rows of plates instead of
family portraits&mdash;this also is &ldquo;high art.&rdquo; Likewise gowns
lumped upon the shoulders, with all the folds drawn across,
instead of hanging draperies. The term is never used
when we speak of the great arts&mdash;painting, sculpture, and
architecture. It is, in fact, only the slang of the cabinet-maker,
the upholsterer, and milliner.</p>

<p>All true Art is very high indeed and apparent; and
needs not to be introduced with a puff. It sits enthroned
between Poetry and History. Even those who are
ignorant of its laws feel its influence, and the soothing
grace which it sheds, falling like the rain, equally upon
the just and the unjust. Man&rsquo;s nature always responds
to the truly high and beautiful; only the most degraded
are deprived of this source of happiness. And there are
but few women, till debased by cruelty, misery, or drink,
that do not try in some humble way (but especially with
their needle) to adorn their own persons, their children,
and their homes; and if their art is not high, it yet has
the power to elevate them.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> While the most ambitious
women try a higher flight, into the regions of poetry,
literature, painting, and even sculpture (why has no
woman ever been an architect?), millions have enjoyed
the art of the needle for thousands of years, and it will
continue to be a solace and a delight as long as the world
lasts, for, like all art, it gives the ever new joy of creation.</p>

Walls, pillars, and roofs were certainly hung with textile ornament
before they were carved or painted. This is Semper&rsquo;s theory, and
though Woltmann and Woermann (&ldquo;History of Painting,&rdquo; Eng. Trans.,
Sidney Colvin, p. 38) hardly accept this view, they do not gainsay it.
The women who wove hangings for the grove, or more literally, &ldquo;coverings
for the houses&rdquo; of the grove, were probably the priestesses of
Astarte, and wove and worked the hangings of various colours. 2 Kings
xxii.; Ezek. xvi. 16-18.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is probable that the earliest kind of pictures were either woven

Surely it is a humanizing and Christian principle which in Italy
permits artistic work to be done in the prisons where criminals are
confined for life. Sisters of Mercy teach lace-making to the wretched
women who, having committed great crimes, may never be seen again.
The produce of the work helps to pay the expense of the prison, and
at the same time a very small percentage is given to the prisoners to
send to their friends, or to spend on little comforts, thus encouraging the
poor human creatures to exercise their best powers. We believe this is
sometimes allowed also in England and France.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>STYLE.</h3>


<p>In venturing to approach so great a subject as the
history of style, I would beg my readers to believe how
well I am aware that on each point much more has been
already carefully treated by previous writers, than will
fall within the limits of a chapter that is intended only
to throw light on textile art, and especially on embroidery.</p>

<p>I suppose it is the same in all subjects of human
speculation which are worthy of serious study; and
therefore I ought not to have been surprised to find
how much has already been written on needlework and
embroidery, and how unconsciously I, at least, have passed
by and ignored these notices, till it struck me that I
ought to know something of the history and principles
of the art which with others, I was striving to revive
and improve.</p>

<p>Then new and old facts crowded round me, and
became significant and interesting. I longed to know
something of the first worker and the first needle; and
behold the needle has been found!&mdash;among the d&eacute;bris
of the life of the Neolithic cave-man, made of bone and
very neatly fashioned.</p>

<p>Alas! the workwoman and her work are gone to dust;
but <em>there</em> is the needle!&mdash;proof positive that the craft
existed before the last glacial period in Britain.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> How
long ago this was, we may conjecture, but can never
finally ascertain. Then I find embroidery named by the
earliest historians, by every poet of antiquity, and by the
first travellers in the East; and it has been the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
of laws and enactments from the date of the Code of
Manu in India, to the present century. One becomes
eager to systematize all this information, and to share
with the workers and thinkers of the craft, the pleasure
found in its study.</p>

<p>Perhaps what is here collected may appear somewhat
bald and disjointed; but antiquity, both human
and historical, is apt to be bald; and its dislocation and
disjointed condition are owing to the frequent cataclysms,
physical, political, and social, which needlework has
survived, bringing down to us the same stitches which
served the same purposes for decoration under the Code
of Manu, and adorned the Sanctuary in the wilderness;
and those stitches probably were not new then.</p>

<p>I propose to give a slight sketch of the origin of the
styles<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> that have followed each other, noting the national
influences that have displaced or altered them, and the
overlap of style caused by outside events.</p>

<p>First, I would define what &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Style</span>&rdquo; means.</p>

<p>Style is the mark impressed on art by a national period,
short or long. It fades, it wanes, and then some historical
element enters on the scene, which carries with it new
materials, needs, and tastes (either imported or springing
up under the new conditions). The style of the day in art
and literature alters so perceptibly, that all who have had
any artistic training are at once aware of the difference.</p>

<p>Of late years, the science of history has been greatly
assisted by the science of language. When the mute
language of art shall have been patiently deciphered,
the historian will be furnished with new powers in his
researches after truth.</p>

<p>The first &ldquo;ineffaceable&rdquo; is a <em>word</em>; the second a
<em>pattern</em>. This is proved by the history of needlework.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
As the world grows old, its youth becomes more interesting.
Alas! the childhood of mankind is so distant,
and it was so long before it learned its letters, that but
few facts have come down to us, on which we may firmly
build our theories; yet we must acknowledge the great
stride that has been made in the last few years, in the
scientific mode of extracting history from the ruins and
tombs, and even the dust-heaps, of the past. Whole
epochs, which fifty years ago were as blank as the then
maps of Central Africa, are being now gradually covered
with landmarks.</p>

<p>Layard, Rawlinson, C. T. Newton, Botta, Rassam, Schliemann,
Birch, G. Smith, and a crowd of arch&aelig;ologists,
and even unscientific explorers, are collecting the materials
from which the history of mankind is being reconstructed.</p>

<p>From them I have sought information about the
art of embroidery, and I find that Semper gives it a
high pre-eminence as to its antiquity, making it the
foundation and starting-point of all art. He clothes not
only man, but architecture, with the products of the loom
and the needle; and derives from them in succession,
painting, bas-relief, and sculpture.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Style has to be considered in two different aspects,
from two different standpoints. First, historically and
arch&aelig;ologically, distinguishing and dating the forms
which follow upon each other; and tracing them back
in the order of their natural sequence; so as to guide us
to the root, nay, to the seed<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of each and all art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
The subsidiary art of embroidery, in its highest form
the handmaid of architecture, is full of suggestion, and
may assist us greatly in the search which culminates in
the text of &ldquo;In the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other point of view from which style should be considered
is the &aelig;sthetic. This enables us to criticize the
works of different periods; extracting, as far as we may,
rules for the beautiful and the commendable, and seeking
to find the &ldquo;why?&rdquo; also observing the operation of the
law by which decay follows too soon after the best and
highest efforts of genius, thought, and invention in art.</p>

<p>My present object is the history of consecutive styles,
in so far as they concern needlework.</p>

<p>Alas! nothing endures. This law is acknowledged by
Goethe, when he makes Jove answer Venus, who bewailed
that all that is beautiful must die,&mdash;that he had only
bestowed beauty on the evanescent.</p>

<p>It seems as if the moment the best is attained, men,
ceasing to struggle for the better, fall back at once
hopelessly and become mere imitators. They no longer
follow a type, but copy a model, and then copy the copy.
Imitation is a precipice, a swift descent through poverty of
thought into the chaos of mannerism, in the place of style.</p>

<p>The imitative tendency, as existing in all human minds,
cannot be ignored or despised. In individuals it accompanies
enthusiasm for the beautiful, and the graceful
charm of sympathy. It maintains continuity between
specimen and specimen, between artist and artist, between
century and century; and it is this which enables an
adept to say with certainty of consecutive styles, &ldquo;This
is Spanish work of the sixteenth century; that is Flemish
or German work of the seventeenth century.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
The theory of development and of the survival of the
fittest has been worked so hard, that it sometimes breaks
down under the task imposed upon it. It would need to
include Death in its procedure. In our creed, Death,
means the moment of entrance into a higher existence;
but in art it means extinction, leaving behind neither a
history nor an artisan&mdash;only, perhaps, an infinitely small
tradition, like the grain of corn preserved in the wrappings
of a mummy, from which at first accident, and then care
and culture, may evoke a future life.</p>

<p>The various ways in which art has appeared at the
beginning cannot here be discussed; nor how the Chinese
and Hindu may have leapt into a perfection which has stood
still for thousands of years, protected alike from expansion
as from destruction, by the swaddling bands of codified
custom; while Greek art rose like the sun, shone over
the civilized world, and set&mdash;never again to see another
epoch of glory. These subjects must be left for the study
of the anthropological philosopher, who is working for the
assistance and guidance of the future historian of art.</p>

<p>Style in needlework has passed through many phases
since the aboriginal, prehistoric woman, with the bone
needle, drew together the edges of the skins of the animals
she had prepared for food.</p>

<p>For absolute necessity, in forming the garments and
covering the tent, needlework need go no further than
the seam. This, however, in the woven or plaited
material, must fray where it is shaped, and become
fringed at the edges. Every long seam is a suggestion,
and every shaped edge a snare.</p>

<p>The fringe lends itself to the tassel, and the shaped
seam suggests a pattern; up-stitches are needed for
binding the web, and before she is aware of it, the worker
finds herself adorning, <em>embroidering</em>; and the craft enters
the outskirts of the region of art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
The humble early efforts at decoration, called by the
French &ldquo;primitif,&rdquo; are the first we know and class, and
are found in all savage attempts at ornament. This
style consists mainly of straight lines, zigzags, wavy
lines, dots, and little discs.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Gold discs of many sizes, and worked with a variety
of patterns, are found equally in the tomb of the warrior
at Mycen&aelig;, and in Ashantee, accompanied in both cases
with gold masks covering the faces of the dead. The
discs or buttons remind us of those found in Etruscan
tombs, though the execution of these last is more advanced.
They appear to be the origin of the &ldquo;clavus&rdquo; or nail-headed
pattern woven into silks in the Palace of the C&aelig;sars.
The last recorded survival of this pattern is in woven
materials for ecclesiastical purposes in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Of very early needlework we only find here and there
a fragment, illustrated occasionally by passing allusions in
poetry and history.</p>

<p>The ornamental art of Hissarlik<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is so primitive that
we cannot feel that it has any resemblance to that
described as Trojan by Homer, who probably adorned
his song with the art he had known elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>We know not what the actual heroes of the Iliad
and Odyssey wore; but we do know that what Homer
describes, he must have seen. Was Homer, therefore,
the contemporary of the siege of Troy?&mdash;or does he
not rather speak of the customs and costumes of his own
time, and apply them to the traditions of the heroic ages
of Greece? Whatever be the date of Homer himself,
we can, with the help of contemporary survivals, reconstruct
the house and the hall, and even furnish them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
and clothe the women and the princes, the beggars and
the herdsmen.</p>

<p>From the remains of Egyptian, Babylonian, and
Assyrian art we can perceive their differences and their
affinities. It is from textile fragments, found mostly in
tombs, that we obtain dates, and can suggest them for
other specimens.</p>

<p>The funeral tent of Shishak&rsquo;s mother-in-law, at Boulac,
is most valuable as showing what was the textile art of
that early period.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

</div>



<p>The corselet which, according to Herodotus, was given
by Amasis, King of Egypt, to the
Temple of Minerva at Lindos, in
Rhodes, was possibly worked in
this style; for Babylonian embroidery
was greatly prized in
Egypt, and imitated.</p>

<p>The second corselet given by
Amasis to the Lac&aelig;demonians
was worked in gold and colours,
with animals and other decorations.
This was of the seventh
century <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the arms painted on the
wall of the tomb of Rameses, at
Thebes (in Egypt), is a corselet, apparently of rich
stuff,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> embroidered with lions and other devices. (Fig. <a href="#fig01">1</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
The Ph&oelig;nicians imbibed and reproduced the styles
they met with in their voyages. The bowls found in
Cyprus described and engraved in the September number
of the &ldquo;Magazine of Art&rdquo; (1883), are most interesting
illustrations of the meeting of two national styles, the
Assyrian and the Egyptian.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Homer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shield of Achilles&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> must, in general design,
have resembled these bowls (see Pl. <a href="#pl05">5</a>). They also
recall the description by Josephus of the Temple veils
at Jerusalem, which were Babylonian.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Ph&oelig;nicia, which was the carrier of all art, dropped
specimens here and there, for many hundred years, along
the borders of the Mediterranean and the coasts of
Spain. We fancy we can trace her ocean-path by the
western shores of Africa, and even to America; otherwise,
how could it happen that a mummy-wrapping in
Peru should so nearly resemble some of those wrappings
found at Saccarah,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in Egypt, woven in precisely the
same tapestry fashion?</p>

<p>Among the puzzling phenomena due probably to Ph&oelig;nician
commerce, is the complete suite of the sacerdotal
ornaments of a High Priest, found in his tomb,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> now in
the Vatican Museum. This reminds us of other specimens
of archaic art from distant sources, that our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
attention is forcibly arrested, and we wonder whence
they came, and whether they were collected from alien
civilizations by the Ph&oelig;nicians before they dispersed
them.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Certain Egyptian sculptures of deformed and repulsive
divinities&mdash;idols of the baser sort&mdash;are most interesting
and puzzling by their affinity in style to the Indo-Dravidian
and the art of Mexico, while they are entirely unlike that
of Egypt. If Atlantis and its arts never existed, it may
be suggested that it was the eastern coast of America
that was spoken of under that name by the Egyptian
priest with whom Herodotus conversed.</p>

<p>The Babylonian and Ninevite embroideries, carefully
executed on their bas-reliefs, have a masculine look, which
suggests the design of an artist and the work of slaves.
There is no following out of graceful fancies; one set of
selected forms (each probably with a symbolical intention)
following another. The effect, as seen on the sculptures
in the British Museum, is royally gorgeous; and one feels
that creatures inferior to monarchs or satraps could
never have aspired to such splendours. Probably the
embroidery on their corselets was executed in gold wire,
treated as thread, and taken through the material; and the
same system was carried out in adorning the trappings
of the horses and the chariots. The solid masses of embroidery
may have been afterwards subjected to the action
of the hammer, which would account for their appearing
like jeweller&rsquo;s work in the bas-reliefs (Pl. <a href="#pl01">1</a> and <a href="#pl02">2</a>).</p>

<p>The style of the Babylonian embroideries appears to
have been naturalistic though conventionalized. We
may judge of their styles for different purposes by the
reliefs in the British Museum. From their veils and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
curtains at a later date, when they had crossed their art
with that of India, we may imagine the mystical design
of the Temple curtain as described by Josephus; in
fact, as much as possible embracing all things on the
earth and above it, excepting the images of the heavenly
bodies.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Small carpets from Persia of the Middle Ages, as well
as those woven and embroidered even to the present
day, are echoes of the ancient Babylonian style, and most
interesting as historical records of the traditions of human
taste. Our artistic interests are stirred when we read in
Ezekiel lists of the fabrics and materials of which Tyre
had become the central dep&ocirc;t, and we enjoy tracing them
to the various looms, named in verse and history, where
they were adorned with embroidery, and then either
became articles of commerce, or were stored away to be
kept religiously as heirlooms, or presented as gifts to
the temples or to honoured guests.</p>

<p>Mr. G. Smith, after saying that the Babylonian is
without doubt the oldest of civilizations, continues thus:&mdash;&ldquo;To
us the history of Babylonia has an interest beyond
that of Egypt, on account of its more intimate connection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
with our own civilization.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Babylon was the centre from
which it spread into Assyria, thence to Asia Minor and
Ph&oelig;nicia, then to Greece and Rome, and so to all
Europe. The Jews brought the traditions of the creation
and of early religion from Ur of the Chaldees,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and thus
preserved they became the heritage of all mankind;
while the science and civilization of that wonderful people
(the Babylonians) became the basis of modern research
and advancement.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The hangings of the Tabernacle are so carefully described
in the book of Exodus, that we can see in fancy
the linen curtains, blue or white, embroidered in scarlet,
purple, blue, and gold; the cherubim in the woven
material; the fringes enriched with flowers, buds, fruit,
and golden bells: and we can appreciate how little of
Egyptian art and style the children of Israel brought
back from their long captivity, and how soon they
reverted to their ancient Chaldean proclivities, after returning
to their wandering life of the tent.</p>

<p>On the bronze gates from the mound of Balawat, near
Nimroud, set up by Shalmaneser to celebrate his conquest
of Tyre and Sidon,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> we find a portable tabernacle, evidently
meant to accompany the army on a march. It is
not much larger than a four-post bed, with transverse
poles for drawing the curtains, all fringed with bells and
fruit. This is an illustration of the motive for the Tabernacle
of the forty years&rsquo; wandering in the desert. (Fig. <a href="#fig02">2</a>.)</p>

<p>Egyptian textile art is, perhaps, that of which we
have the most early specimens. These are to be seen
at Boulac, at Vienna, Turin, and the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
The Hieroglyphic, the Archaic, and the Gr&aelig;co-Egyptian
are all unmistakably the consecutive outcome
of the national original style, which had totally disappeared
in the beginning of our era. Few of the
embroideries are more than two thousand five hundred
years old. But the great piece of patchwork in leather,
&ldquo;the funeral tent of an Egyptian queen,&rdquo; as it covered
the remains of a contemporary of Solomon,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> absolutely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
exhibits the proficiency of the designer and the needlework
of the eleventh century <small>B.C.</small> (Pl. <a href="#pl44">44</a>.)</p>

<p>The connection between Indian and Egyptian early
art appears to have existed only in their use of the lotus
as an emblem and a constant decoration; but their
manner of employing it was characteristically different.
(Pl. <a href="#pl12">12</a> and <a href="#pl13">13</a>.)</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nicians carried with them the seeds of the
Egyptian style over the ancient world; but these seeds
only took root and flourished on the soil of Greece. The
imitations of Egyptian style reappeared in Rome, and
again in France &ldquo;under the two Empires.&rdquo; In both
cases they were only imitations, and neither had any
permanent influence on the art of their day.</p>

<p>I shall have to allude very often to our Eastern
sources of artistic culture.</p>

<p>Our own Aryan ancestors were so impregnated with
beautiful ideas, that we must believe that we inherit from
them all our graceful appreciation of naturalistic ornament.
But even Aryan art met with reverses on its
Eastern soil, from which it constantly rose again and
renewed itself.</p>

<p>The Mongols crushed for a time the element of beauty
in India. They introduced a barbarous and hideous
style which has its only counterpart in that of Central
America. It was the produce of a religion, superstitious,
cruel, and devilish.</p>

<p>The Aryan art of India, which was elegant and spiritual,
was revived by the kindred influence of Persia, and by
the Renaissance in Europe. Italian and other artists
were employed in India, and &ldquo;the spirit of aerial grace,
and the delicate sense of beauty in natural forms,
blossomed afresh and flourished for 300 years. Birds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
flowers, fruit, butterflies, became once more the legitimate
ornament of every material.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>I continue to quote from Sir G. Birdwood&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arts of
India.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Code of Manu, from 900 to 300 <small>B.C.</small>, has
secured to the village system of India a permanent class
of hereditary artistic workmen and artisans, who have
through these 2500 years, at least, been trained to the
same manipulations, and who therefore translate any
foreign work which is placed before them to copy, into
something characteristically Indian.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Indian art has
borrowed freely from all sources without losing its own
individuality. It has been said, &ldquo;There is nothing
newer in it than of the sixteenth century; and even then
nothing was original, especially in the minor arts.&rdquo; But
this is owing to the Hindu being equally endowed with
assimilative and receptive capacity,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> so that in the hands
of the Indian craftsman everything assumes the distinctive
expression of ancient Indian art.</p>

<p>In India everything is hand-wrought; but as the spirit
of its decorative art &ldquo;is that of a crystallized tradition,
its type has remained almost unaltered since the Aryan
genius culminated in the Ram&acirc;yana and Mahabh&acirc;rata&mdash;and
yet each artisan in India is a true artist.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In art,
unfortunately, &ldquo;the letter killeth;&rdquo; and true artists as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
are, the ancient traditions bind and cramp them, while
the ancient materials, the dyes, and the absolute command
of time are failing: so that the beauty of Indian embroideries
and other decorations is gradually reducing itself
to mannerism, which is more dangerous to art than even
had been the vicissitudes of war; for when peaceful days
returned, and the waves of conquest had subsided, the
ancient arts were found again deeply embedded in the
traditions of the people. They gradually returned to
their old ways, which are so indelible in the Hindu mind,
that they will perhaps survive even the fashions of to-day.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>From Yates&rsquo; account it would appear that Europe
had been fertilized with taste in art and manufactures
from the East by three different routes.</p>

<p>The Egyptian civilization, with all its Eastern antecedents
and traditions, came to us by the Mediterranean
and the Adriatic; the Ph&oelig;nicians being the merchants
who brought it through those channels. The Etruscans,
who were the pedlars of Europe, travelled north, conveying
golden ornaments and coral, and bringing back
jet and amber. Their commercial track is to be traced
by the contents of tombs on their path.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="caption">St. John. From King Alfred&rsquo;s Celtic Book of the Gospels.<br />

<p>Secondly, there was also a Slavonian route from
Eastern Asia, which conveyed Oriental art to the north
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
of Europe. Celtic art, which certainly has something
of the Indo-Chinese style, came to us probably by this
route. Another branch of the Celtic family was settled
on the north-eastern shores of the Adriatic. Celtic
ideas and forms in art probably crossed Europe from
this point,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and came to us meeting a cognate influence,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
arriving from the north.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> (Pl. <a href="#pl03">3</a>.)</p>

<p>Thirdly, Oriental taste and textiles came from the
Byzantine Empire in the early days of Christianity,
spreading to Sicily, Italy, Spain, and finally to France,
Germany, and Britain.</p>

<p>Runic art, whether Scandinavian or our own purer
Celtic, is so remarkable for its independence of all other
European national and traditional design, that I cannot
omit a brief notice of it, though we have no ascertained
relics of any of its embroideries.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It appears to have
received, in addition to its own universal stamp&mdash;evidently
derived from one original source&mdash;certain
influences impressed on it like a seal by each country
through which it flowed.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Wherever the Runes are

carved in stone, or worked on bronze, gold, silver, ivory,
or wood, or
painted in their
splendid illuminations
(pl. <a href="#pl04">4</a>),
the involved serpent,
which was
the sign of their
faith, appears,
sometimes covered
with Runic inscriptions; and this inscribed serpent,
later, is twined round or heaped at the foot of the
peculiar Scandinavian-shaped cross, the type of conversion.
The serpent was sometimes altered into the
partial semblance of a four-footed animal, the body and
tail being lengthened and twined, and sometimes split,
to give a new turn to the pattern. (Fig. <a href="#fig03">3</a>.) All these
zoomorphic patterns, as well as the human figures seen
in the Book of Kells, the missal at Lambeth, and the
Lindisfarne Book (which is, however, more English in its
style), are yet of an Indo-Chinese type; the wicker-work
motives often replacing the involved serpent design.</p>

<p>The Paganism of our own Celtic art, when it appears,
is an interpolation between our first and second Christian
conversions, and was brought to us in the incursions of
the Vikings over Scotland and into England.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of their advanced and most singular art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
comes out of their tombs, in which the warrior was laid
with all his arms and his horse and his precious possessions,
splendidly clothed according to his degree&mdash;in
the belief that he would need them again in a future
world.</p>

<p>This northern tradition was so long-lived, that
Frederick Casimir, a knight of the Teutonic Order, was
buried with his sword and his horse at Treves, in 1781.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Greek embroideries we can perfectly appreciate, by
studying Hope&rsquo;s &ldquo;Costumes of the Ancients,&rdquo; and the
works of Millingen and others; also the fictile vases in
the British Museum and elsewhere. On these are depicted
the Hellenic gods, the wars, and the home life
of the Greeks. The worked or woven patterns on
their draperies are infinitely varied, and range over many
centuries of design, and they are almost always beautiful.
It is melancholy to have to confess that in this, as in all
their art, the Greek taste is inimitable; yet we may profit
by the lessons it teaches us. These are: variety without
redundancy; grace without affectation; simplicity without
poverty; the appropriate, the harmonious, and the serene,
rather than that which is astonishing, painful, or awe-inspiring.
These principles were carried into the smallest
arts, and we can trace them in the shaping of a cup
or the decoration of a mantle, as in the frieze of the
Parthenon.</p>

<p>Homer makes constant mention of the women&rsquo;s work.
Penelope&rsquo;s web is oftenest quoted. This was a shroud
for her Father-in-law. Ulysses brought home a large
collection of fine embroidered garments, contributed by
his fair hostesses during his travels.</p>

<p>Pallas Athene patronized the craft of the embroiderers;
and the sacred peplos which robed her statue, and was
renewed every year, was embroidered by noble maidens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
under the superintendence of a priestess of her temple. It
represented the battles of the gods and the giants (fig. <a href="#fig04">4</a>),
till the portraits of
living men were profanely
introduced into
the design. The
new peplos was carried
to the temple,
floating like a
flag, in procession
through the city.</p>

<p>The goddess to
whom the Greeks
gave the protection
of this art was wise
as well as accomplished,
and knew
that it was good
for women reverently
to approach
art by painting with
their needles. She
always was seen in
embroidered garments,
and worked
as well as wove them
herself. She appeared
to Ulysses in the
steading of Eum&oelig;us,
the swineherd, as a
&ldquo;woman tall and fair, and skilful in splendid handiwork.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

Homer never tires of praising the women&rsquo;s work, and
the chests of splendid garments laid up in the treasure-houses.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Helen gave of her work to Telemachus:
&ldquo;Helen, the fair lady, stood by the coffer wherein were
her robes of curious needlework which she herself had
wrought. Then Helen, the fair lady, lifted it out, the
widest and most beautifully embroidered of all&mdash;and it
shone like a star; and this she sent as a gift to his
future wife.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Semper&rsquo;s theory is, that the one chief import of Oriental
style being embroideries, therefore the hangings and
dresses arriving from Asia gave the poetic Greek the
motives for his art, his civilization, his legends, and his
gods.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> This may or may not be; there is no doubt that
they influenced them.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>B&ouml;ttiger accordingly believes that Homer&rsquo;s descriptions
of beautiful dress and furnishings are derived from, or at
least influenced by, what he had learnt of the Babylonian
and Chaldean embroideries. This is very probable, and
would account for his poetical design on the shield
of Achilles, in which his own inspiration dictated the
possibilities of the then practised arts of Asia, of which
the fame and occasional glimpses were already drifting
westward. (Plate <a href="#pl05">5</a>.)</p>

<p>The description of the shield of Achilles is as follows:
Hephaistos, &ldquo;the lame god,&rdquo; &ldquo;threw bronze that weareth
not, into the fire; and tin, and precious gold and silver.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He fashioned the shield great and strong, with five folds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
(or circles) in the shield itself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then wrought he the
earth and the sea, and the unwearying sun, and the
moon waxing to its full, and the signs, every one wherewith
the heavens are crowned.&rdquo; &ldquo;Also he fashioned
therein two cities of mortal men; and here were marriage
feasts, and brides led home by the blaze of torches&mdash;young
men whirling in the dance, and the women standing
each at her door marvelling.&rdquo; Then a street fight, and
the elders sitting in judgment. The other city was being
besieged; and there is a wonderful description of the
battle fought on the river banks, and &ldquo;Strife, Tumult,
and Death&rdquo; personified, and mingling in the fight.
Then he set in the shield the labours of the husbandman.
This is so exquisitely beautiful that with difficulty I refrain
from quoting it all. &ldquo;He wrought thereon a herd of
kine with upright horns, and the kine were fashioned of
gold and tin,&rdquo; &ldquo;and herdsmen of gold were following
after them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Also did the glorious lame god devise a
dancing-place like unto that which once, in wide Knosos,
Daidalos wrought for Ariadne of the lovely tresses.
There were youths dancing and maidens of costly wooing,
their hands upon their waists.&rdquo; &ldquo;And now would they
run round with deft feet exceedingly lightly&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and
now would they run in lines to meet each other.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
a great company stood round the lovely dance in joy;
and among them a divine minstrel was making music on
his lyre; and through the midst of them, as he began
his strain, two tumblers whirled. Also he set therein the
great might of the River of Ocean, around the utmost
rim of the cunningly-fashioned shield.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>There is, indeed, every proof that Greek art was the
joint product of the Egyptian and Assyrian civilizations.
Their amalgamation gave birth to the archaic style,
struggling to express the strength and the beauty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
man&mdash;half heroic, half divine. Gradually, all the surrounding
decorations of life assumed as a governing principle and
motive, the worth of noble beauty.</p>

<p>The Greeks were the first artists. They broke away
from the ancient trammels of customary forms, and
replaced law with liberty of thought, and tradition with
poetry.</p>

<p>They destroyed no old ideas, but they selected,
appropriated, and evoked beauty from every source.
From the great days of Athens we may date the
moment when materials became entirely subservient
to art, and the minds of individual men were stamped
on their works and dated them. Phases indeed followed
each other, showing the links of tradition which
still bound men&rsquo;s minds together to a certain extent,
and formed the general style of the day. Yet there
was in art from that time&mdash;life, sometimes death,&mdash;but
then a resurrection.</p>

<p>It appears from classical writers that about 300 <small>B.C.</small>
Greek art had thrown itself into many new forms.
Painting, for example, had tried all themes excepting
landscapes. We are told that within the space of 150
years the art had passed through every technical stage;
from the tinted profile system of Polygnotus to the proper
pictorial system of natural scenes, composed with natural
backgrounds; and Peirai&iuml;kos is named as an artist of
genre&mdash;a painter of barbers and cobblers, booths, asses,
eatables, and such-like realistic subjects.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>I suppose there is no doubt that all the Romans knew or
felt of art was borrowed directly or indirectly from Greece,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
first through Ph&oelig;nician and perhaps Etruscan sources,
and finally by conquest. Everything we have of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
art shows their imitation of Grecian models. Their
embroideries would certainly have shown the same
impress.</p>

<p>Greece&mdash;herself crushed and demoralized&mdash;even as
late as the Eastern Empire gave to Rome the fashion of
the Byzantine taste, which she at once adopted, and it was
called the Romanesque. This style, which was partly
Arab, still prevails in Eastern Europe, having clung to
the Greek Church. In her best days, Roman poetry,
architecture, and decorative arts were Greek of Greece,
imitating its highest types, but never creating.</p>

<p>It is surely allowable to quote here one of Virgil&rsquo;s
Homeric echoes, which touches upon our especial
subject,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>It is sad to mark how not only the refinements of
taste, but even the guiding principles of art, were
gradually lost in the humiliation of a conquered people,
the dulness and discouragement which followed on
the expatriation or destruction of their accumulated
treasures, and the deterioration of the Greek artist and
artisan, carried prisoners to Rome, and settled there
because it was the seat of luxury and empire. As the
captive Jews hung their harps on the willow-trees by
the waters of Babylon, and refused to sing, so Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
genius succumbed, weighed down by Roman chains. It
sickened and died in exile.</p>

<p>Late Roman art reminds us of the art of Etruria in its
archaic days, except that the freshness and promise are
wanting, and that the one was in its first, the other its
second childhood.</p>

<p>Before entering on the subject of Christian art, I
must again refer, however briefly, to the Eastern origin
of all art. It is evident that this had always flowed in
streams of many types from that high watershed of
Central Asia, where our human race is said to have been
created, and whence all wisdom and knowledge have
emanated. In the image of the Creator, man issued
from thence, endowed with the gift of the creative power.
Wave after wave of fresh and apparently differing nationalities
followed each other; partially submerging those
that had gone before, and spreading till it had reached
the furthest shores of the Northern seas and the Atlantic,
and encircled the Mediterranean. They all followed the
same course from east to west. The Greek civilization
was indeed so dazzling and strong, that it lighted the
world all around; and India, Persia, and Assyria felt its
influence reflected back on its old Asian cradle.</p>

<p>But from the same high watershed<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> flowed other
tribal types towards China, Java, and Japan, that had
no affinity with any western civilization; and while the
Assyrian, Persian, Indian, and Mongolian styles mixed
and overlapped so near their sources, that it is sometimes
hardly possible to reason out and classify their resemblances
and their differences, the tribes flowing
Eastward turned aside and went their own way, and have
remained till now perfectly distinct.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
In spite of their matchless dexterity in the manipulation
of their materials, the infinite variety of their
stitches, and exquisite finish in execution, carrying out to
the utmost point the intended effect, yet Chinese and
Japanese textile art differs in its inner principles from all
our accepted canons of taste; so that their want of
harmony, and sometimes their absurdity, is a puzzle of
which we cannot find the key. This I have already
alluded to (p. <a href="#Page_3">3</a>).</p>

<p>I purposely avoid the questions suggested by Chinese
art. The immense antiquity it claims cannot be allowed
without hesitation. M. Terrien de la Couperie, however,
believes that he has found the actual point of departure
of Chinese civilization, and he considers it to be an early
offshoot from Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> He supports his theory on
linguistic grounds, and we must anxiously wait to see
if it is corroborated by further researches into the earliest
records of the archaic Chinese literature. But immobility
in art is a Chinese characteristic, and no national
cataclysms seem to have disturbed it. The oldest
specimens known are very like the most modern. Yet
an adept, learned in Chinese art, can detect the signs
which mark its different epochs.</p>

<p>In this they differ from the Japanese, who, added to their
inherited exquisite appreciation of natural beauty, have a
power of assimilation that might lead in time to their
possessing a school of art which, being really original,
might become the style of the future. The civilization
of Japan is not older than the fifth century <small>A.D.</small>, and was
probably then imported from Corea. Some of the earliest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
specimens we know of their art are embroidered religious
pictures by the son of a Mikado Sholokutaiski, who was
in the seventh century the great apostle of Buddhism in
Japan; and the next earliest works are by the first nun,
Honi, in the eighth century. We have European work as
old, and it is most interesting to compare the differences
of their styles and stitches.</p>

<p>We must now return to the beginning of our era, when
we find Greek taste, such as it was, still influencing and
colouring art in Italy, and throughout Europe, Asia, and
Africa, wherever Roman colonies were founded, till the
eighth century. It died hard; but by that time the
barbarians had poured from the east and north in
successive waves, and conquered and suppressed the
classical civilization.</p>

<p>Nothing is so puzzling in textile art as the mixture of
styles during the first 1000 years <small>A.D.</small> The Gr&aelig;co-Roman,
the Byzantine, and the Egyptian, crossed by the Arabian,
Persian, and Indian styles, were reproduced in the Sicilian
looms. Certain stock patterns, such as the reclining hares
or fawns, as we find them on the Shishak pall, or that of
the Tree of Life, approached by worshipping men or
animals, originating in Assyrian art, are employed as
borders, and fill up vacant spaces. The information
collected from the tombs in the Crimea immediately
preceding our era, is supplemented by the variety in
style and materials from the Fayoum, now placed by
Herr Graf&rsquo;schen in the Museum at Vienna.</p>

<p>Christian art, which began in Byzantium, gradually
grew, and formed itself into the Gothic,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> which in time
overcame the general chaos of style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
Eastern art continued to flow westward, modifying
and suggesting. When the Ph&oelig;nicians and Carthaginians
had laid down their ancient commercial sceptre, it was
taken up by the Greeks, and later by the Venetians and
Genoese, always trading with Asiatic goods. Then the
arts of the Scandinavians<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and of the Celts (who were
the weavers), though barbaric, still retained and spread
certain Oriental traditions. Luxury was born in Babylon,
and Persia became its nurse, whence all its glories and
refinements spread over the world. But if luxury was
Babylonian, art was Greek. Alas! the love of luxury
survived in Rome the taste for art.</p>

<p class="caption">The Empress Theodora. Mosaic at Ravenna. Church of San. Vitale.</p>

<p>At Ravenna we learn much of the early Christian
period from the mosaics in the churches. The Empress
Theodora and her ladies appear to be clothed in Indian
shawl stuffs. (Plate <a href="#pl06">6</a>.) These, of course, had drifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
into Rome, as they had long done into the Greek islands,
by the Red Sea or by land through Tyre. Ezekiel (590
<small>B.C.</small>) mentions the Indian trade through Aden. Theodora&rsquo;s
dress has a deep border of gold, embroidered
with classical warriors pursuing each other with swords.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Works enriched with precious stones and pearls now
appear for the first time in European art, and testify to
its Oriental impress.</p>

<p>The Byzantine Christian style was essentially the art
of mosaic. Its patterns for architecture or dress, easily
square themselves into little compartments, suggesting
the stitches of &ldquo;counted&rdquo; embroideries (&ldquo;opus pulvinarium&rdquo;).</p>

<p>In the beginning of the fourth century, when Greek
influence was still languishing, we may date the commencement
of ecclesiastical art. It was a new birth, and
had to struggle through an infancy of nearly 800 years,
ignoring, or unconscious of all rules of drawing, colouring,
and design. Outlines filled in with flat surfaces of
colours represented again the art of painting, which had
returned to archaic types, and in no way differed from
the essential properties of the art of &ldquo;acu pingere&rdquo; or
needlework, which was in the same phase&mdash;being, fortunately
for it, that to which it was best suited.</p>

<p>Therefore fine works of art were then executed by the
needle, of which a very few survive, either in description
or copied into more lasting materials; and showing that,
with the minor arts of mosaic and illumination, it was
in a state of higher perfection than the greater arts,
which till the twelfth century were all but in abeyance.</p>

<p>In discussing textile art, I am obliged to pass over
a part of the dark ages, and to approach the period when
it must be studied chiefly in Sicily, which became the
half-way house on the high road to the East, and later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
the resting-place of the Crusaders to and from the Holy
Land.</p>

<p>Sicily, which had succeeded to Constantinople as being
the great manufacturing mart during the Middle Ages,
was in the hands of the Moors, the origin and source of
all European Gothic textile art. Yet even at Palermo
and Messina this art was long controlled by the traditions
of Greece, ancient and modern, while fertilized by Persian
and Indian forms and traditional symbolisms.</p>

<p>The next European phase was the Gothic.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> This was
Arab and Moresque steeped in northern ideas; and
finding its congenial soil, it grew into the most
splendid, thoughtful, and finished style, far transcending
anything that it had borrowed from eastern or southern
sources.</p>

<p>All its traditions were carried out in the smaller
decorative arts&mdash;mosaics, ivories, and metal works;
and, last and not least, beautiful embroideries, to
adorn the altars and the dresses of monarchs and
nobles. (Plate <a href="#pl07">7</a>.)</p>

<p>When taste was imperfect or declined, then the decorations
were all rude, and the embroideries shared in
the general rudeness or poverty; but as these crafts rose
again, adding to themselves grace and beauty by study
and experience, then needlework in England, Germany,
France, Italy, and Spain grew and flourished.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

Then came the Reformation, which, in Germany and
England especially, gave a blow to the arts which had
reserved their best efforts for the Church; and the change
of style effected by the Renaissance was not suited to
the solemnity of ecclesiastical decoration.</p>

<p>The styles of the fifteenth and sixteenth century
embroideries are better adapted for secular purposes;
though their extreme beauty as architectural ornament in
Italy, reconciles one to their want of religious character,
on the principle that it was allowable to dedicate to the
Church all that in its day was brightest and best.
(Plate <a href="#pl08">8</a>.)</p>

<p>We possess much domestic embroidery of the Renaissance
which is exceedingly beautiful&mdash;Italian, Spanish,
and German. English needlework had lost its prestige
from the time of the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The best efforts of the German schools of embroidery
preceded the Reformation, while those of Belgium never
lost their excellence,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and still hold their high position
among the workers of golden orphreys. In Italy they
always retained much of the classical element. Probably
the ancient frescoes which served as models were
originally painted by Greek artists and their Roman
imitators. This style flourished for a hundred years.
The French adopted and modified it.</p>

<p>The decorative style of that period is sometimes
called the Arabesque, and sometimes the Grotesque.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
The fashion was really copied from the excavated palaces
and tombs of the best Roman era. Raphael admired,
and caused his pupils to imitate and copy them; and
they influenced all decorative art for a considerable
period. As long as beautiful forms of flowers, fruit,
birds, and animals were adhered to, the Arabesque was
a charming decoration, gay and brilliant; but when the
beautiful was set aside, and the ugly ideas were reproduced,
the style became the Grotesque, which word
only means the grotto, cave, or tomb style, and is as
undescriptive to us as the word Arabesque, which has
nothing to do with the Arabs or their arts.</p>

<p>It would appear that if the beautiful only is permissible
in decorative art, and that if without beauty there is no
reason that it should exist at all, then the Grotesque
should not be allowed, except as a scherzo of the pencil;
to be relegated, like all other caricatures, to the portfolio.</p>

<p>A grotesque is something startling, laughable, perhaps
ridiculous. A woman with the head of a goose and a
flowery tail may be a symbolical, but it never can be an
agreeable object. When the idea conveyed is a great
one, then it is excusable. The Ninevite bull, with a
human head and five legs, is a grotesque, but it is also a
symbol of majesty and might. A Satyr is a grotesque,
but he has been so long recorded and accepted that he
has ceased to surprise us; and the Greeks spent so
much genius in making him a graceful creature, that he
has become picturesque, if not beautiful.</p>

<p>Arabesques and Grotesques have now so long prevailed
in decoration, that we have ceased to criticize them on
principle, and accept them gratefully, in proportion to
the gay fancy and reticent genius of the designer.
Most Arabesques are, in fact, only graceful nonsense.</p>

<p class="caption">Spanish Coverlet, from Goa. Velvet and gold, Pl&acirc;teresque style, seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Vitruvius (writing first century <small>B.C.</small>) says, that &ldquo;in his
time, on the covering of the walls were painted rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
monstrosities than images of known things. Thus,
instead of columns you will see reeds with crisp foliage,
and candlesticks supporting temples; and on the top of
these there are rods and twisted ornaments, and in the
volutes senseless little figures sitting there; likewise
flowers with figures growing out of their calyxes. Here
a human head, there an animal&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Evidently Vitruvius
did not approve of grotesques, and his contemporary
criticism is most valuable and amusing.</p>

<p>In the Louis Quatorze period, a species of vegetable
grotesque was the fashion, from which we suffer even
now, and it deserves censure. Leaves and flowers of
different plants were made to grow from the same
stem, as only artificial flowers could do. The Greeks
introduced into their decorations sprays and wreaths
of bay, olive, oak, ivy, and vine, with their fruits;
which are exquisitely composed and carefully studied
from nature. It is true that they sometimes invented
flowers of different shapes, following each other on the
same stem, and untrammelled by any natural laws.
These classical freaks of fancy are so graceful that their
want of truth does not shock us, but they are more safely
copied than imitated.</p>

<p>The Renaissance was particularly marked in Spain and
Portugal by the embroideries which the latter drew from
their Indian possessions in Goa, whilst we in England
were sedulously thrusting from our shores any beautiful
Indian textiles that we imagined could injure our own
home manufactures. It was, consequently, the worst
phase of needlework with us, while Spanish and Portuguese
embroideries of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries are especially fine, their designs being European,
and their needlework Oriental. Their Renaissance, which
went by the name of the Pl&acirc;teresque, is a style apart. (Pl. <a href="#pl09">9</a>.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
The reason of its name is that it seems to have been
originally intended for, and is best suited to, the shapes
and decorations of gold and silver plate. It is extremely
rich and ornate; not so appropriate to architecture as to
the smaller arts, and wanting, perhaps, the simplicity
which gives dignity. The style called Louis Quatorze
following on the Renaissance in Germany, England,
Spain, Italy, and France, assumed in each of these countries
distinguishing characteristics, into which we have not
time to enter now. In this style France took the lead
and appropriated it, and rightly named it after the
magnificent monarch who fostered it. This was a
splendid era; and its furniture and wall decorations,
dress, plate, and books shine in all the fertile richness
and grace of French artistic ingenuity.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The new style
asserted itself everywhere, and remodelled every art; but
the long reign of Louis Quatorze gave the fashion time
to wane and change. Under Louis XV. the defects
increased and the beauties diminished. The fine heavy
borders were broken up into fragmentary forms; all flow
and strength were eliminated; and what remained of the
Louis Quatorze style became, under its next phase, only
remarkable for the sparkling prettiness which is inherent
in all French art.</p>

<p>In Italy this very ornate style was distinguished as the
&ldquo;Sette-cento,&rdquo; and was a chastened imitation or appropriation
of the Spanish Pl&acirc;teresque and the French
Louis Quatorze. In Germany it was a decided heavy
copy of both, of which there are splendid examples in
the adornment of the German palaces, royal and episcopal.
In England the Continental taste was faintly
reflected during the reign of Queen Anne and the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
Georges; but except in the characteristic upholstery of
the Chippendales, and one or two palaces, such as
Blenheim and Castle Howard, we did not produce much
that was original in the style of that day.</p>

<p>Under Louis XV., Boucher and Watteau, in France,
produced designs that were well suited to tapestries
and embroideries. All the heathen gods, with Cupids,
garlands, floating ribbons, crowns, and cyphers were
everywhere carved, gilded, and worked. It was the
visible tide of the frivolity in which poor Marie Antoinette
was drowned; though before the Revolution she had
somewhat simplified the forms of decoration, and straight
lines instead of curves, and delicacy rather than splendour,
had superseded, at least at court, the extravagant richness
of palatial furniture.</p>

<p>This was followed by the Revolution; and then came
the attempt at classical severity (so contrary to the
French nature) which the Republic affected.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Dress was
adorned with embroidered spots and Etruscan borders,
and the ladies wore diadems, and tried to be as like
as possible to the Greek women painted in fictile art.
Napoleon attempted a dress which was supposed to be
Roman at his coronation. Trophies were woven and
embroidered, and the &ldquo;honeysuckle,&rdquo; &ldquo;key,&rdquo; and &ldquo;egg and
anchor&rdquo; patterns were everywhere. With the fall of the
Empire the classical taste collapsed, and the Egyptian,
Greek, and Roman furniture were handed over to hotels
and lodging-houses. In most of the palaces on the
Continent an apartment is still to be seen, furnished in
this style. It was the necessary tribute of flattery to the
great conqueror, who in that character inhabited so many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
of them for a short time. But there was no sign of the
style being taken up enthusiastically anywhere out of
France.</p>

<p>After the fall of the Empire, all pretence of style was
in abeyance, and it was then gradually replaced by a
general craving for the &ldquo;antique,&rdquo; the &ldquo;rococo,&rdquo; and
finally the &ldquo;baroc,&rdquo; as the outcome of that part of a
gentleman&rsquo;s education called the &ldquo;grand tour.&rdquo; Every
one bought up old furniture; Italy and Spain were
ransacked; and foreign works of all ages were added to
the hereditary house furnishings. Every wealthy home
became a museum. Now the numerous exhibitions of
the last few years, bringing together the works of all
Europe and other continents, have enabled us to continue
to collect and compare and furnish, without any
reference to a particular style.</p>

<p>Meantime &ldquo;Young England&rdquo; had become &aelig;sthetic.
Bohemianism was the fashion, and the studio had to be
furnished as a picturesque lounge:&mdash;ragged tapestries
for backgrounds; antique chairs and bits of colour as
cushions and draperies; shiny earthenware pots to hold
a flower and to catch a high light. All these bridged
the space between the new &aelig;stheticism and the old family
museums; and from their combination arose the style
called by courtesy the &ldquo;Queen Anne&rdquo;&mdash;a style which
can be brought within the reach of the most moderate
fortunes. In humble mansions you will be aware of the
grouping of the old pieces of furniture, culminating
perhaps in &ldquo;my grandmother&rsquo;s cabinet,&rdquo; and her portrait
by Hogarth; or &ldquo;my great-grandfather&rsquo;s sword and
pistols, which he carried at Culloden;&rdquo; and his father&rsquo;s
clock, a relic perhaps of the Scotch Dutch.</p>

<p>The English style of to-day is really a conglomerate
of the preceding two hundred years, and it is formed
from the d&eacute;bris of our family life. It belongs mostly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
the period of the pigtail; but it stretches back, and
includes all that followed the Protectorate, and is therefore
coeval with the wig. The name of &ldquo;Queen Anne&rdquo;
would really do as well as any other, only that the
style of her reign, which was heavy Louis Quatorze, is
looked upon with suspicion, and never admitted for
imitation. The &ldquo;Nineteenth Century&rdquo; would be a better
name, for it has formed itself only within the last thirty
years, in the very heart of the century, and is, in fact, a
fortunate result of preceding conditions. It owes its
existence, as I have said, partly to the arch&aelig;ological
tendencies of the day.</p>

<p>The maimed tables and chairs, which had painfully
ascended from saloon to bedroom, nursery, and attic, till
they reposed in the garret (the Bedlam of crazy furniture),
now have descended in all the prestige of antiquarian
and family interest. Their history is recorded; the old
embroideries are restored, named, and honoured. What
is not beautiful, is credited with being &ldquo;quaint&rdquo;&mdash;the
&ldquo;quaint&rdquo; is more easily imitated than the beautiful; and
we have elected this for the characteristic of our new
decorations. To be quaint, is really to be funny without
intending it, and its claim to prettiness is its <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>,
which is sometimes touching as well as amusing: this
was the special characteristic of the revival in the Middle
Ages. To imitate quaintness must be a mistake in art;
as in life it is absurd to imitate innocence.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century &ldquo;Queen Anne&rdquo; has its merits.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
It combines simplicity, roominess and comfort, colour,
light and shade. Soft colouring to harmonize the new
furniture with the tender tints of the faded quaintnesses
just restored to society; care in grouping even
the commonest objects, so as to give pleasure to the
eye; a revived taste for embroidered instead of woven
materials, giving scope to the talents of the women of
the house;&mdash;all these are so much gained in every-day
domestic decoration. The poorest and most trivial
arrangements are striving to attain to a something
artistic and agreeable. This is still confined to the
educated classes; but as good and bad alike have to
begin on the surface, and gradually filter through to the
dregs of society, we may hope that the women who
wore the last chignon and the last crinoline may yet
solace their sordid lives in flowing or tight woollen
garments, adorned with their own needlework; and that
the dark-stained floor of the cottage or humble lodging
will set off the shining brass kettle, and the flower in a
brown or blue pot, consciously selected with a view to
the picturesque, and enjoyed accordingly.</p>

<p>From what we know, it would seem that a vital change
in a national style is never produced by the inspiration
of one individual genius or great original inventor. It
invariably evolves itself slowly, by the patient, persistent
efforts of generations, polishing and touching up the
same motive, and at last reaching human perfection.</p>

<p>The annihilation of a style is oftenest caused by war
passing over the land, or revolution breaking up the fountains
of social life, and swamping the art and the artist.</p>

<p>But another cause of such an extinction&mdash;perhaps the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
saddest&mdash;is that having reached perfection as far as it
may, it deteriorates, sickens, corrupts, and finally is
thrown aside&mdash;superseded, hidden, and overlapped by
a newer fashion; and the worst and latest effort discredits
in the eyes of men, the splendid successes that
preceded its fall. Though the next succeeding phase
may be less worthy to live than the last, yet, carrying
with it the freshness of a new spring, it is acceptable for
the time being.</p>

<p>The moral I should draw from this is, that you
cannot force style; you may prune, direct, and polish
it, but you must accept that of your day, and only in
accordance with that taste can your work be useful.
Not accepting it idly or wearily, but cheerfully, on
principle, seeking to raise it; refusing by word or deed
to truckle to the false, the base, or the lawless in your
art, or to act against the acknowledged canons of good
taste. Not for a moment should ambition be checked,
but it should always be accompanied by the grace of
modesty.</p>

<p>To the young decorator or artist who feels the glow
of original design prompting him to reject old lines,
and follow his own new and perhaps crude ideas, a few
words of warning, and encouragement also, may be of
use.</p>

<p>In art, as in poetry, we may recognize the Psalmist&rsquo;s
experience: &ldquo;My heart burned within me, and at the last
I spake with my tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In small as in great things, crude ideas should not be
brought to the front. No one should give his thoughts
to the world till his heart has <em>burned</em> within him, and he
has been <em>forced</em> to express himself.</p>

<p>Another wise saying, &ldquo;Read yourself full, and then
write yourself empty,&rdquo; also applies to art. Knowledge
must first be accumulated before you can originate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
Wait till your experience and your thoughts insist
on expression; then subject the expressed idea to cultivated
criticism, and profit by the opinion you would
respect if another&rsquo;s work, and not your own, were under
discussion.</p>

<p>It is true that taste is surprisingly various. Some will
dislike your design, because its style is a reflection of
the Gothic; another may be objected to as being
frivolously Oriental-looking and brilliant, whereas the
critic likes only the sober and the dull. Few are sufficiently
educated to appreciate style: and we cannot
rule our own by anybody&rsquo;s opinion; but we can generalize
and find something that shall be agreeable to all&mdash;something
approaching to a golden mean. The artist
for decoration should be sensitively alive to any suggestion
from the style of that which he is to adorn, remembering
the antecedent motives of its form, its history,
and its date. He should try to make his new work
harmonize with the old; but of one thing he may be
certain&mdash;unless he absolutely copies an old design, his
own will carry the visible and unmistakable stamp of
his day.</p>

<p>Even while suggesting copies this difficulty arises&mdash;how
can a perfect facsimile be obtained? No reproduction
is ever really exact, unless cast off by the hundred,
stamped or printed by a machine.</p>

<p>It has been said that the translator of a poem adds to,
or takes from the original, that which he has or has not of
the same poetical power; and in art the copy requires the
same qualities to guide the hand that transmits the original
motive to another material. An artist usually carries
out his own ideas from the first sketch blocked out on
the canvas, or scribbled on the bit of waste paper, to the
last finishing touch. It is, as far as it can be in human
art, the visible transcript of his own thought. In needlework
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
this can hardly ever be. The designer, whether
he be St. Dunstan, Pollaiolo, Torrigiano, or Walter
Crane, only executes a drawing which leaves his hands
for good, and is translated into embroidery by the patient
needlewoman who simply fills in an outline, ignorant of
art, unappreciative of its subtleties, and incapable of
giving life and expression, even when she is aware that
they are indicated in the original design. This is almost
always the case; but there are exceptions. Charlemagne&rsquo;s
dalmatic, for instance, shows signs of having been either
the work of the artist himself, or else carried out under
his immediate supervision.</p>

The history of Gaul begins in the 7th, and that of Britain in the 1st
century <small>B.C.</small>, while the civilization of Egypt dates back to more
than 4000 <small>B.C.</small>; therefore the historical overlap is very great. It is
probable that a large portion of Europe was in its neolithic age, while
the scribes were composing their records of war and commerce in the
great cities on the Nile, and that the neolithic civilization lingered in
remote regions while the voice of Pericles was heard in Athens, and the
name of Hannibal was a terror in Italy.&mdash;See Boyd Dawkins&rsquo; &ldquo;Early

&ldquo;The Beautiful Gate of the Temple was covered all over with
gold. It had also golden vines above it, from which hung clusters of
grapes as tall as a man&rsquo;s height.... It had golden doors of 55
cubits altitude, and 16 in breadth: but before these doors there was a
veil of equal largeness with the doors. It was a Babylonian curtain of
blue, fine linen, and scarlet and purple; of an admixture that was truly
wonderful. Nor was the mixture without its mystical interpretation;
but was a kind of image of the universe. For by the scarlet was to be
enigmatically signified fire; by the fine flax, the earth; by the blue, the
air, and by the purple, the sea;&mdash;two of them having their colours for
the foundation of this resemblance; but the fine flax and the purple
have their own origin for this foundation, the earth producing the one,
and the sea the other. This curtain had also embroidered upon it all that
was mystical in the heavens excepting the twelve signs of the zodiac,
representing living creatures.&rdquo; Josephus (Trans. by Whiston), p. 895.</p>

Sir G. Birdwood repeatedly points out that the Vedic was the art
that worshipped and served nature. The Puranic is the ideal and
distorted. The Moguls, about 700 <small>B.C.</small>, introduced their ugly Dravidian
art. Through the Sassanian art of Persia, that of India was influenced.
Possibly the very forms which in India are copied from Assyrian temples
and palaces, may have travelled first to Assyria upon Indian stuffs and
jewellery (Sir G. Birdwood&rsquo;s &ldquo;Industrial Arts of India,&rdquo; i. p. 236).</p>

See Sir G. Birdwood, p. 129 (ed. 1884). If Fergusson is right in
suggesting that the art of Central America was planted there in the
third or fourth century of our era, it would, perhaps, appear to have
taken refuge in America when it was driven out of India by the Sassanians,
and was really Dravidian. He gives to the Turanian races all the mound
buildings, as well as the fylfot or mystic cross, and he looks in Central
India for the discovery of some remains that will give us the secret of
the origin of the Indo-Aryan style. He thinks the Archaic Dravidian
is allied with the Chinese. See Fergusson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Architecture.&rdquo;</p>

The different Celtic nationalities are always recognizable. There
was found in a grave-mound at Hof, in Norway, a brooch, showing at a
glance that it was Christian and Celtic, though taken from the grave of
a pagan Viking. Another at Berdal, in Norway, was at once recognized
by M. Lorange as being undoubtedly Irish. There are many other
instances of evident Celtic Christian art found on the west coast of
Norway under similar conditions&mdash;probably spoil from the British
Islands, which were subject to the descents of the pagan Vikings for
centuries after the time of St. Columba&rsquo;s preaching of Christianity in
Scotland. For information on the subject, see G. Stephen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monuments

to it those Teutonic conquerors, but how vast was the cost to the world,
occasioned by the necessity of casting into the boiling cauldron of
barbarous warfare, that noble civilization and the treasures which Rome
had gathered in the spoil of a conquered universe! Had any old
Roman, or Christian father been gifted with Jeremiah&rsquo;s prescience, he
might have seen the fire blazing amidst the forests of Germany, and the
cauldron settling down with its mouth turned towards the south, and
would have uttered his lamentation in plaintive tones, such as Jeremiah&rsquo;s,

Scandinavian art became strongly tinctured with that of Byzantium.
The Varangian Guards were, probably, answerable for this, by their
intercourse between Greece and their native land, which lasted so
many centuries. There have come down to us, as witnesses of this
intercourse, many coins and much jewellery, in which all that is
Oriental in its style has been leavened by its passage through Byzantine
and Romanesque channels. Gibbon, writing of this period, says: &ldquo;The
habits of pilgrimage and piracy had approximated the countries of the
earth&rdquo; (see Gibbon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Decline and Fall,&rdquo; chap. lv.).</p>

<p>Greek embroidered patterns and Greek forms of dress still linger in

might have belonged to the Greek wife of a Varangian guardsman.
It is embroidered with a border in gold of the classical honeysuckle
pattern; and the bridal wreath of gilt metal flowers might, from its
style, be supposed to have been taken from a Greek tomb.</p>

The descent from the Persian of Arab or Moorish art, as we generally
call it when speaking of its Spanish development, is to be accounted
for by the presence of a considerable colony of Persians in Spain in
the time of the Moors, as attested by numerous documents still in
existence. See Col. Murdoch Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Preface to Persian Art,&rdquo;

In his designs for papers and textiles, Mr. Morris&rsquo; poetical and
artistic feeling&mdash;his admiration and sensitiveness for all that is beautiful
and graceful (as well as quaint)&mdash;his respect for precedent, added to his
own fanciful originality,&mdash;have given a colour and seal to the whole
decorative art of England of to-day. It is a step towards a new school.
The sobriety and tenderness of his colouring gives a sense of harmony,
and reconciles us to his repetitions of large vegetable forms, which remind
us sometimes of a kitchen-garden in a tornado. For domestic decoration
we should, as far as possible, adhere to reposing forms and colours.
Our flowers should lie in their allotted spaces, quiet and undisturbed by
elemental struggles, which have no business in our windowed and
glass-protected rooms.</p>

<p>The word design, as applied to needlework, includes
the principles and laws of the art: the motives and their
hereditary outcome; the art creating the principles; the
laws controlling the art.</p>

<p>Design means intention, motive, and should as such
be applied to the smallest as to the greatest efforts of art.
That which results from it, either as picture or pattern,
is a record of the thoughts which produced it, and by its
style fixes the date, of its production.</p>

<p>I will first consider the principles of design, and
afterwards, in another chapter, inquire into the origin of
<a href="#Page_82">patterns</a>; investigating their motives, and using them as
examples, and also as warnings.</p>

<p>The individual genius of the artist works first in design,
though his work is for the use of the craftsman or artisan,
his collaborator; for the two, head and hands, must work
together, or else will render each other inoperative or
ineffective.</p>

<p>The artisan, by right of his title, claims a part
in the art itself; the craftsman, by his name, points
out that he, too, has to work out the craft, the mystery,
the inner meaning, of the design or intention.</p>

<p>The designer himself is subject to the prejudices called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
the taste of his day. He is necessarily under the influence
which that taste has imposed upon him, and from which
no spontaneous efforts of genius can entirely emancipate
him. Whether he is conceiving a temple for the worship
of a national faith, or the edging for the robe of a fair
votaress, or the pattern on the border of a cup of gold or
brass, he cannot avoid the force of tradition and of
custom, which comes from afar, weighted with the power
of long descent, and which crushes individuality, unless
it is of the most robust nature.</p>

<p>Of very early design we have most curious and
mysterious glimpses. The cave man was an artist.
The few scratches on a bone, cleverly showing the forms
of a dog or a stag, a whale or a seal, nay, the figure of a
man, have enabled us to ascertain and to classify the
Pal&aelig;olithic cave man; from whom his less civilized
successor, the Neolithic man, may be distinguished by
his absence of all animal design.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>These fragmentary scraps of information, pieced together
only in these later years, teach us the value of
very small facts which time and care are now accumulating,
and which, being the remains of lives and nations
passed away, still serve as the soil in which history can
be fertilized.</p>

<p>We have no means of judging whether the cave man
was an artist on a greater or more advanced scale than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
is actually shown by the bone-scratchings; the only other
relic of his handiwork is the needle.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that a direct imitation of nature, such as
is seen in these &ldquo;graffiti,&rdquo; and at an immense distance in
advance of them, in the earliest known Egyptian sculptures,
preceded all conventional art. Some of the earliest portrait
statues in the Museum at Boulac exhibit a high
degree of naturalistic design before it became subservient
to the expression of the faith of the people. As soon as
art was found to be the fittest conveyance of symbolism,
it became the consecrated medium for transmitting language,
thought, and history, and was reduced to forms
in which it was contented to remain petrified for many
centuries, entirely foregoing the study or imitation of
nature.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> It recorded customs, historical events, and
religious beliefs; receiving from the last the impress of
the unchangeable and the absolute, which it gave to the
other subjects on which it touched. It ceased to be a
creative art (if it had ever aspired to such a function),
and was never the embodiment of individual thought.
This phase prevailed under different manifestations in
Assyria and China. Pictorial art had, in fact, become
merely the nursing mother of the alphabet, guiding its
first steps&mdash;the hieroglyphic delineation or expression of
thoughts and facts.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
In Egypt, the change from the first period of actual
imitation of nature was succeeded by many centuries of
the very slowest progress. Renouf speaks,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> however, of
&ldquo;the astonishing identity that is visible through all the
periods of Egyptian art&rdquo; (for you could never mistake
anything Egyptian for the produce of any other country).
&ldquo;This identity and slow movement,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are not
inconsistent with an immense amount of change, which
must exist if there is any real life.&rdquo; In fact, there were
periods of relative progress, repose, and decay, and
every age had its peculiar character. Birch, Lepsius, or
Marriette could at once tell you the age of a statue,
inscription, or manuscript, by the characteristic signs
which actually fix<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> the date.</p>

<p>Design, unconsciously has a slowly altering and persistently
onward movement, which but seldom repeats
itself. It is one of the most remarkable instances of
evolution. But it also has its cataclysms (however we
may account for them), of which the Greek apotheosis
of all art is a shining example, and the total disappearance
of classical influence in Europe before the Renaissance
is another.</p>

<p>I will instance one prevailing habit of Egyptian art.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
In the long processional subjects, and in individual
separate figures, it was usual to draw the head in perfect
profile, the body facing you, but not completely&mdash;a sort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
of compromise with a three-quarter view of it&mdash;and the
feet following each other, on the same line as the profile.
This mode of representing the human figure was only
effaced gradually by the introduction of Greek art, and
continued to be the conventional and decorative method
even in the latest days of Egyptian art; and it is curious
to observe, that in the Dark ages European design fell
into the same habit. We cannot imagine that this
distorted way of drawing the human figure could have
any intentional meaning, and therefore may simply believe
that it had become a custom; and that when art has so
stiffened and consolidated itself by precedent and long
tradition, as in Egypt and in India, certain errors as
well as certain truths become, as it were, ingrained into
it. Plato remarked of Egyptian art, that &ldquo;the pictures
and statues they made ten thousand years ago were in
no particular better than those they make now.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>One day, however, the Greek broke away from the
ancient bonds of custom. The body was made to
accompany the head, and the feet followed suit. But
the strange fact remains that for several thousand years
men walked in profile, all out of drawing. Evidently
originality was not in much estimation among the
Egyptian patrons of art. Design seemed to have restricted
itself to effective adaptations in a few permitted
forms in architecture and painting, and the illumination
of the papyrus MSS.</p>

<p>Egyptian elasticity of design found some scope in its
domestic ornamentation, in jewellery and hangings, but
especially in its embroideries for dress. Here much
ingenuity was shown, and the patterns on walls and the
ceilings of tombs give us the designs which Semper
considers as having been originally intended for textile
purposes. He strains to a point to which I can hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
follow him, the theory that all decorations were originally
textile (except such as proceeded in China from
the lattice-work motive); though I willingly accept the
idea that textile decoration was one of the first and most
active promoters of design.</p>

<p>It is not possible for us to trace systematically the
different points at which Egyptian and Asiatic art touch,
but we can see that they were always acting and reacting
on each other in the later centuries before our era, and
that Greece profited by them. The first efforts of both
to break through this chrysalis stage, resulted in the
early Greek archaic style. Its strongly marked, muscular
humanity reminds one of all the conflicting impressions
struggling in the conception of the great artist who first
embodied them. They appear to be breaking out from
the trammels of Egyptian and Assyrian styles, which
by meeting had engendered life; and Greek art was the
child of their union. Then art, having shaken off
symbolism as its only purpose, and seeking to represent
the forms of men, yet possessed by a guiding spirit,
first sought to convey the idea of expression. The
worship of humanity, mingling with that of their gods,
produced the Heroic ideal; and all the attributes of their
heroes&mdash;majesty, beauty, grace, and passion&mdash;had to be
depicted; as well as rage, sorrow, despair, and revenge.
These were soon to be surrounded with all the splendours
of the arts of decoration.</p>

<p>Greece had prepared for this outburst of excellence
and the perfect science of art, by collecting the traditions,
the symbols, the experience in colouring, and the knowledge
of beautiful forms, human and ideal. All that was
needed for the advent of the man who could design and
create types of beauty for all ages was thus accumulated,
and the man came, and his name was Pheidias. A crowd
followed him, all steeped in the same flood of poetry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
and art; and for several centuries they filled the world
with the sense and science of beauty. Then the function
of the designer&mdash;the artist&mdash;was changed and elevated,
and he became, through the great days of Greek and
Roman Pagan art, and afterwards through the rise of
that of Christianity, the exponent of all that was poetical
and ennobling in the life of man.</p>

<p>But though the Greek artist had broken the chains of
prescribed form, he still adhered to the &ldquo;motive&rdquo;&mdash;the
inner symbolical thought&mdash;and strove to express it as it
had never been expressed before.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> New principles were
evoked, and the artist, while revelling in the &ldquo;sweetness
and light&rdquo; of freedom, framed for himself standards of
taste and refinement, which he left as a heritage to all
succeeding generations.</p>

<p>I fear that I am repeating a platitude when insisting
that freedom in all design, but especially that
employed in decoration, must be kept within certain
boundaries; otherwise it becomes lawless. Rules, like
all other controlling circumstances, are of the greatest
service to the artist, as they suggest what he can do, as
well as decide what he ought not to attempt. All boundaries
are highly suggestive; the size of a sheet of
paper&mdash;the form of a panel&mdash;the colours in the box of
pigments&mdash;even the touch of the brush which comes to
hand,&mdash;all these help to shape the idea to our ends,
and assist us in giving to the original motive the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
form which is most suitable. These restrictions are
often regarded as impediments by the impatient artist;
whereas he ought to look on them as hints and suggestions,
and claim their assistance, instead of struggling
against them. Let us accept the principle that it is
good for each of our efforts at decoration that we are
controlled by the space allotted to its composition.
The relative size (small, perhaps, for a table-cover, but
large for that of a book) and the shape to which we are
limited, alter all the conditions of a design. Whether it
is square or oblong, or lengthened into a frieze; whether
it must be divided into parts, including more than one
motive, or be grouped round one centre; whether it is
to be repeated more than once within the range of the
eye, or whether it is to disappear into space upwards or
horizontally; and whether it is to stand alone, or be
framed with lines or a border,&mdash;all these restrictions
must govern the design, or, in its highest phase, the
composition.</p>

<p>The composition must consist of supporting lines well
balanced, and &ldquo;values&rdquo; filling up the whole surface of
the space, which is to contain it, and beyond which it
must not seek to extend. As we have in embroidery
no distances&mdash;only a foreground&mdash;the design must be
placed all on one plane. The title of &ldquo;composition&rdquo;
cannot be granted to a bouquet or a bird cast on one
corner of a square of linen, however gracefully it may be
drawn. It does not cover the space allotted to it.</p>

<p>If we carefully study the great and guiding principles
that have been distinctly formulated by some of the
Continental authorities on decorative art, we shall find
much help in composing our designs. Nothing is more
interesting than to search for the foundation of the
structure which centuries have helped to raise, and to
dig out, as it were, the original plan or thought of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
founder. So it is most instructive to learn the fundamental
rules by which such results are secured.</p>

<p>M. Blanc<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> says of the general laws of ornamentation:
&ldquo;There can be no nobler satisfaction to the mind, than
to be able to unravel what is beyond measure complicated,
to diminish what is apparently immense, and to reduce
to a few clear points what has been till now involved in
a haze of obscurity. Just as the twenty-six letters of
the alphabet have been, and always will be sufficient to
form the expression of the words necessary for all human
thought, so certain elements susceptible of combination
among themselves have sufficed, and will suffice, to
create ornament, whose variety may be indefinitely
multiplied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reduces ornamental design to five principles, Repetition,
Alternation, Symmetry, Progression, and Confusion.</p>

<p><a name="fig05" id="fig05"></a></p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 5.<br />
Wave Pattern.</span>
</div>

<p>First, Repetition. &ldquo;You may act on the mind, through
sight, by the same means as those that will excite
physical sensations. A single prick of a pin is nothing,
but a hundred such will be intolerably painful. Repetition
produces pleasurable sensations, as well as painful
ones.&rdquo; An insignificant form can become interesting by
repetition, and by the suggestion which, singly, it could
not originate. For example,
the rolling of the
Greek scroll or wave
pattern awakens in us
the idea of one object
following another. &ldquo;It
also suggests the waves of the ocean; or the poet may
see in it a troop of maidens pursuing each other in space,
not frivolously, but in cadence, as if executing a mystic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
dance.&rdquo; Change the curves into angular forms, as making
the key pattern, and it will no
longer flow, but become as
severe as the other was graceful.
No principle gives greater
pleasure than repetition, and
next to it, <em>alternation</em>.</p>

<p><a name="fig06" id="fig06"></a></p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 6.<br />
Key Pattern.</span>
</div>

<p>Variety is here added to the law of repetition. &ldquo;There
can be repetition without alternation, but no alternation
without repetition.&rdquo; Alternation is, then, a succession of
two objects recurring regularly in turn; and the cadence
of appearance and disappearance gives pleasure to the
senses, whether it be addressed to taste, hearing, or
sight. Alternate rhymes, and even short and long lines,
soothe the ear in verse. In form, the alternations are
the more agreeable, the more they differ. Such are, in
architecture, a succession of metopes and triglyphs on a
Doric frieze, where the circle and the straight lines
relieve each other.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 500px;">

alt="Linear patterns with circular motifs" />
</div>

<p class="caption">Fig. 7.<br />
Metopes and Triglyphs.</p>

<p>Symmetry. The correspondence of two parts opposite
to each other is symmetrical. &ldquo;A living being,
man or animal, is composed of two parts, which appear
to have been united down one central line. Without
being identical, if you folded them down the line,
they would overlap and perfectly cover each other.
Man is born with the sense of symmetry, to match his
outward form; and he appreciates its existence, and
instinctively feels the want of it. Symmetry is another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
word for justness of proportion. The Greeks understood
by symmetry, the condition of a body of which the
members have a common measure among themselves.
We expect the two sides of a living being to correspond,
and we look for these proportions in the living body
to balance each other, which we do not expect to find
in any other natural object. A large leaf at the end of
a slender stem may be as appropriate, and give as much
pleasure, as a small leaf in the same position; but a huge
hand at the end of an arm is not so agreeable to our
sense of symmetry as one of the size and outline which
we naturally expect to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mind of man expects to find, outside of himself
and his own proportions, something which he feels is
proportionate and symmetrical; in fact, he at once
detects the want of it. The Japanese, with delicacy and
taste, often substitute for symmetry its corollary&mdash;balance.
The Chinese or Japanese vase will often have an
appreciable affinity and resemblance to a Greek one, each
preserving a secret balance, even in the extremest
whimsicality of its composition. Proportion is another
corollary to symmetry, if it is not another word for some
of its qualities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Progression. In this principle are included long
perspectives, pyramidal forms in architecture, and certain
processional compositions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For pyramidal surfaces, such as pediments, a progressive
ornament is the fittest. All the buildings in the
East, and in the ancient cities of Central America, which
are raised on pyramids of steps, show the tendency to
this species of effect in giving dignity to the buildings
placed on such platforms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perspectives are highly attractive specimens of progression,
which, when made use of in the decorations of
a theatre, produce delightful illusions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
M. Blanc quotes Bernardin de St. Pierre, who says:
&ldquo;When the branches of a plant are disposed in a uniform
plan of diminishing size, as in the pyramidal shape of a
pine, there is progression; and if these trees be planted
in long avenues, diminishing in height and colour, as
each tree does in itself, our pleasure is redoubled, because
progression here becomes infinite. It is owing to this
feeling of infinity that we take pleasure in looking at
anything that presents progression, such as nurseries in
different stages of growth, the slopes of hills retreating
to the horizon at different levels&mdash;interminable
perspectives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All floral compositions which give the effect or impression
of growth may be included in the progressive
principle. A composition which, beginning as it were
with a stem, spreads and floreates equally on each side;
thrusting outwards and upwards, and ending in a topmost
twig or bud, is governed by this principle.</p>

<p>Confusion. Boileau is quoted by M. Blanc as saying,
&ldquo;A fine disorder is often the effect of art;&rdquo; and he adds,
&ldquo;But before he said it, nature had shown it.&rdquo; Here we
must observe that the confusions or disorders of nature are
all subject to certain laws; and it is in adopting this idea,
that an artistic confusion may give us the sense of its
being ordered by, and subject to definite rules. These
rules act as the frame affects the picture, circumscribing
its irregularities, and restricting them to a certain area.
&ldquo;The artist-painter is, in a small space, permitted to
employ confusion, because the art of the cabinet-maker
will keep the geometrical effect in view.&rdquo; When the
Japanese throw their ornaments, apparently without rule,
here and there on the japanned box, they reckon on the
square shape being sufficiently marked to the eye by its
shining surface and sharp corners.</p>

<p>The confusion in a Japanese landscape is so beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
that one appreciates the innate sense of balance, which
modifies the confusion&mdash;rules and orders it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the hands of the designer, confusion is only a
method of rendering order visible in a happy disorder.
Here contraries meet and touch.... Admit these as
the principles of all decoration, and you will find that,
by following and combining them, you may produce
varieties as numberless as the sands of the sea, and that
a latent equilibrium will reduce nearly every complication
and confusion to perfect harmony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each of the five principles we have discussed has its
corollary, which adds to the resources of the decorative
artist. These are as follows:&mdash;To Repetition belongs
harmony, or consonance; to Alternation, contrast; to
Symmetry, radiation; to Progression, gradation; to
balanced Confusion, deliberate complication.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><em>Harmonies</em> in form and in colour are produced in
different ways&mdash;sometimes by repetition with variation;
sometimes by the different parts being rather reflected
on each than repeated. This explains the harmony that
may be called consonance, if I rightly understand
M. Blanc&rsquo;s theory.</p>

<p><em>Contrast</em> is most generally understood as a common
resource in the hands of the artist for producing strong
effects; but M. Blanc cleverly expresses the reticence
needed to ensure contrast being pleasurable, not painful.
&ldquo;To adorn persons or things,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is not simply
for the purpose of causing them to be conspicuous; it is
that they may be admired. It is not simply to draw
attention to them, but that they may be regarded with
feelings of pleasure.... If contrast be needed, let it be
used as the means of rendering the whole more powerful,
brilliant, and striking. For instance, if orange is intended
to predominate in a decoration, let blue be mingled with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
it, but sparingly. Let the complementary colour be
its auxiliary, and not its rival.&rdquo; Contrasts are always
unpleasant, if the two forces struggle with each other for
pre-eminence, whether it be in form or in colour. The
rule to be observed in all ornamental design is this:
&ldquo;that contrasting objects, instead of disturbing unity,
should assist it by giving most effect to that we wish to
bring forward and display.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Radiation</em> belongs to the principle of symmetry, starting
from a centre from which all lines diverge, and to which
all lines point. This is to be found throughout nature,
from the rays of the sun to the petals of the daisy.
All decorative art employs and illustrates it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Gradation</em> in colour, as in form, is not quite synonymous
with progression, but expresses a series of
adroitly managed transitions. The English intermingle
in their decoration, colours very finely blended; nor do
they find any transition too delicate. This, as in all
principles of ornament, has to be employed according to
the feelings intended to be produced on the mind of the
spectator&mdash;whether for absolute contrast or for imperceptible
progression, when the tenderest colours are needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Complication</em> is illustrated by M. Blanc, by a quotation
from &ldquo;Ziegler.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> &ldquo;Complication is another aspect of the
art which owns the same sentiment as that expressed by
D&aelig;dalus in his labyrinth, Solomon in his mysterious
seal, the Greeks in their interlacing and winding ornaments,
the Byzantines, the Moors, and the architects of
our cathedrals in their finest works. Intertwined
mosaics, and intersection of arches and ribs, all spring
from complication.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To follow the interlacing line of an ornament, gives
the mind the pleasure of untying the Gordian knot, without
cutting it. It gives the excitement of curiosity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
pursuit, and discovery. &ldquo;When we see these traceries
so skilfully plaited, in which straight lines and curves
intermingle, cross, branch out, disappear and recur, we
experience a high pleasure in unravelling a puzzle which
at first, perhaps, appeared to be undecipherable; and in
acknowledging that a latent arrangement may be recognized
in what at first, and at a distance, seems an
inextricable confusion.&rdquo; The Celtic, Moorish, and Gothic
styles illustrate and are explained by these remarks;
and they are well worthy the attention of the designer.</p>

<p>Having so freely borrowed from M. Blanc&rsquo;s chapter
on the general laws of ornamentation, I will finish my
quotations with the words with which he concludes:
&ldquo;There is no decoration in the works of nature or the
inventions of men which does not owe its birth to one of
the original principles here enumerated, viz. Repetition,
Alternation, Symmetry, Progression, and Balanced
Confusion; or else to one of their secondary causes,
consonance, contrast, radiation, gradation, and complication;
or lastly, to a combination of these different
elements, which all finally lose themselves in a primordial
cause&mdash;the origin of the movements of the universe&mdash;<span class="smcap">Order</span>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The extracts from M. Blanc&rsquo;s works I have carefully
placed between commas, being most anxious to express
my obligation to him for his carefully formulated epitome
of the laws of design. But though I have largely quoted,
there remains still much most interesting and suggestive
matter, which I recommend the reader to seek in his
book.</p>

<p>Though we should call to our aid the general laws of
design for all art, we must select from them what is
specially appropriate for the needs of our craft. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
the art of needlework we should eliminate as much as
possible all ideas of <em>roundness</em>, all variety of surface and
effects of light and shadow and contrasting colours.
Unity, softness, grace, refinement, brightness, cheerfulness,
pleasant suggestions,&mdash;these should be the objects
in view when we design the panels for the drawing-room
or boudoir, the hangings for the bed, or the cover for
the table&mdash;harmony which will satisfy the eye, thoughts
that shall please the mind.</p>

<p>The objects in nature that give us the most unalloyed
pleasure&mdash;birds and flowers&mdash;are those that from all
time have served as the materials for decorative design,
and therefore have been moulded into the traditional
patterns which have descended to us from the earliest
times. Design must follow the scientific laws of art,
and shape the variations of traditional forms from which
we cannot escape. In our present search after these
inner truths, I repeat that we have nothing to do with
the rules of painting, sculpture, and architecture, or
any other of the secondary arts, such as wood carving,
metal work, &amp;c.; these having each their own intrinsic
principles, which must be worked out as corollaries from
the general laws of composition which govern all Aryan
art.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>It is curious that in drawing on the flat, in ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
frescoes, there appear to be no acknowledged rules of
perspective&mdash;hardly more in Pompeii, than on early
Chinese screens and plates; or than later in the Bayeux
tapestries. And yet the Greeks, with their unerring
instinct, actually made use of false architectural perspectives
to add to the effects of height and depth in their
colonnaded buildings.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> They sensibly diminished the
circumference of the columns, and used other means in
their designs for this purpose. They understood the
principle, but they did not carry it into flat decorative art.
They did not attempt, when they painted a landscape on
the wall, to do more than recall the idea they were
sketching; and never thought of vying in scientific or
naturalistic imitation with the real landscape they saw
through the window; they did not wish to interfere with
the effect of the statue, or the human figures grouped in
front of it, to which the wall served as a background.
Those threw shadows and cast lights; but in the flat
there were no shadows, no perspective&mdash;all was flat.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
We must draw from this the deduction that the Greeks
held that flatness was an essential quality of wall decoration
(except in friezes) as well as of all textile ornament;
and for every reason we must accept this flatness as a
general law for designs in embroidery.</p>

<p>In hangings and dress materials, flatness is more
agreeable than a complicated shaded design, especially
when it is further confused by folds, disturbing and
interrupting the flow of the lines of the pattern.</p>

<p>The reader will perceive that the laws of composition
for textiles quoted from M. Blanc, apply perfectly to
designs on the flat, and to outlined sketches in black and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
white, as well as to the most elaborate compositions for
pictures, either historical or &ldquo;genre.&rdquo; They are rules
which should be understood and employed by the man
who draws for a wall-paper or an area railing; and
certainly by him who makes patterns for our schools of
design.</p>

<p>It may therefore be laid down as a general rule, that all
designs for embroidery should be considered first as outlined
drawings, covering a flat surface, and then filled in
with colour. The outlines should as little as possible overlap
one another, as flatness is one of the first objects to
be remembered; and this, of course, will be disturbed by
the parts passing over or under each other. Indian
designs in flowers have invariably a wonderful flatness,
in the absence of all light and shadow; joined to a
naturalistic suggestion of detail, which is accounted for
by their traditional mode of copying from nature. The
branch or blossom to be copied, is laid on the ground
and pegged down with care, to eliminate every variety
of surface, and every branch and twig so arranged that
they may not cross or touch each other. This conventional
composition is then drawn, and every natural
distinction in the form carefully copied. I would
suggest that this idea should be accepted as useful
for imitation among ourselves in certain conventional
compositions of vegetable forms. Perhaps it is our Aryan
ancestry that has given us a prevailing taste for such
decorations; and it is worth while to consider how best
to manipulate them.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Clinging as we do to these floral designs, we can see
that they are the only ones that bear repetition, whether
covering the surface of the material in the rich irregularity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
of the flowers in a field, or conventionalized into a form
or a pattern.</p>

<p>The eye is never shocked or fatigued by such repetitions
in orderly confusion, or trained by the hand into
artistic shapes or meanderings of tracery. But when
embroidery or weaving attempts to represent animals or
typical human figures, repetition immediately becomes
tiresome. A Madonna surrounded by angels, comes in
badly, repeated over and over again as a pattern, broken
up by folds, cut up by a seam, dislocated in the joining,
and repeated in tiers. Such a design is figured in
Auberville&rsquo;s book.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The drawing is beautiful, but by
repetition it becomes ridiculous. I therefore deprecate
this kind of ornament in textile work. For this reason
embroidery, which can be fitted to each space that is to
be covered, is preferable to woven designs, however
richly or perfectly they may be carried out.</p>

<p>Another class of design, which must be considered
apart, is the conventional-geometrical, of which the
special distinction appears to be that it consists of
echoes or fragments of what we have seen elsewhere.
These conventional patterns are often merely the <em>detritus</em>
of past styles or motives crushed and placed by time in
a sort of kaleidoscope. They remind one of the little
wreaths of broken shells and coloured sea-weeds left on
the sands by the retiring waves after a storm, and are
sometimes full of beauty and suggestion. (Pl. <a href="#pl17">17</a>.) We
trace in these fragmentary patterns forgotten links with
different civilizations; and we ponder on the historical
events which have brought them into juxtaposition.
These kaleidoscope patterns are to be seen in Persian
and Turkish carpets of the present day, and we find, on
examination, little bits which can only be the remnants
of a broken-up motive, probably as much lost now to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
designer who inherits the traditional form, as to us who
can only see the vague results.</p>

<p>I illustrate this remark by giving the border of a
modern Persian carpet which has certainly had Egyptian
ancestry. The boat, the beetle, and the prehistoric cross
are to be found in it.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/naaf08.jpg" width="600" height="327"
alt="Decorative linear patterns on a carpet border" />
</div>

<p class="caption">Fig. 8.<br />
Persian Carpet.</p>

<p>Many conventional patterns of to-day are descendants
of the lattice-work of Chinese art, and of the zigzags,
lines, and discs of barbarous primitive ornamentation.</p>

<p>The traceries in Indian stone windows show some of
the most charming geometrical forms, and are akin to
the Persian and Russian modes of composing conventional
patterns. They appear on very ancient metal work, and
are the motives of all the embroideries in the Greek
islands and the principalities, and of the linen embroideries
of Russia. Their Byzantine origin gave its
impress to the European schools of the Middle Ages,
and the pattern-books of Germany and Venice of the
sixteenth century are full of them. They are best
suited for the mosaic stitches, and, kept in their places
as decoration, they are useful for carpets and borders.</p>

<p>It should be impressed on our young artists, that, in
composing their designs, they must be influenced by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
materials to be employed, and the purpose for which the
decoration is intended. Thus in textile design for
dress and hangings (excepting for tapestries) the fact
must never be lost sight of that they will be subject
to disturbance by crossing folds and crumplings, which
will break up the lines of the pattern. It is therefore
evident that a design fitted for a rigid material in a
fixed place, such as an architectural decoration in wood,
stone, or stucco, must be subject to a treatment different
from that which befits an embroidered curtain or
panel.</p>

<p>Stone and wood, being materials of uniform colour,
require all the help of recessed shadows and projections
to catch the light; whereas in textiles, form is assisted by
colour, and smoothness of surface is a primary consideration.
The strongly accentuated design for wood-carving
becomes poor and lifeless when deprived of its essential
conditions and <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>, and the pattern which looks
charming, outlined and filled in with colour, could be
hardly seen incised on a flat stone surface. This seems a
truism, but the neglect of these plain axioms causes many
mistakes in decorative art. Mr. Redgrave says: &ldquo;A
design must be bad which applies the same treatment to
different materials.&rdquo; He further says: &ldquo;The position of
the ornament requires special consideration. The varied
quantities, bolder relief, and coarser execution are not
only allowable, but absolutely necessary, at heights considerably
above the eye. Moreover, each fabric has its
own peculiar lustre, texture, &amp;c. Thus, in the use of
hangings, curtains, &amp;c., the design might be suitable in
silk, and coarse or dull in woollen.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Here I venture to differ from Mr. Redgrave. Perspective
is as much to be respected in decoration as in
pictures, near to the eye; and the gradation in size and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
colour, as the ornament travels up into height or fades
into distance, is a phase of pleasure which should not be
checked by enlargement of form or reinforcement of
colouring.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to warn our artists against a sort
of design which is conventional, yet had its own meaning
in the beginning. This is to be found in Indian carvings
and embroideries of a certain date, or imitating the works
of that distant period. It proceeded from a hideous
worship of monstrous Dravidian divinities. Their statues
are to be found, surrounded by coarsely designed patterns,
in the temple architecture of the first and second centuries.
Its characteristics are idols in niches or shrines, distorted
in form or attitude; foliage of unnatural, twisted plants,
added to the recurring of the lotus and tree of life; or
animals destroying each other, or kneeling in worship to
the idols. These ugly designs are purely conventional.
Fergusson suggests that they were introduced into
Mexico in the fourth or fifth centuries <small>A.D.</small> by Buddhism.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Those many-armed, sometimes many-faced divinities
drove out the beautiful Aryan types, which, however,
resumed their sway when the wave of the Renaissance
flowed back to India, and was remodelled by Oriental
taste to the lovely designs we find in the Taj Mahal.</p>

<p>In M. Blanc&rsquo;s classification of ornament, he has placed
Gothic design under the head of deliberate complication.
The whole of the Gothic decorations, which are a gradual
growth in one direction, arose from the study of interlacing
boughs and stems, employed as the enrichment of
the newly-grown forms of the vaulted roofs. The possibilities
of great size and height covered these designs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
inspired all their decoration; and the effect of reiteration
and long recurring lines in perspective was essentially
the motive of these avenues in stone.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Here enter the principles of repetition and progression,
and you will find how carefully the designers of the
twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries worked up
to these ideas. You will see in their embroideries, shining
figures or pictures in gold, silver, and coloured silks,
shimmering on dark velvet backgrounds, each design
terminating a perspective of architectural forms which
enhances their brilliancy. The most effective, probably,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
were generally employed for the adornment of the high
altar, so as to be seen from a great distance. The
smaller and less distinct and more delicate ornaments
were reserved for the side chapels or for smaller churches,
where such distant effects were inappropriate. But the
motives of <a href="#Page_303">ecclesiastical embroidery</a> will be discussed in
a future chapter.</p>

<p>All attempts at pictorial art are a mistake in textiles. It
does not enter into such designs; and when by chance
it is allowed to be so used, it is an error of judgment,
and only exhibits a laborious and useless ingenuity. It
is no longer an artistic delineation of a natural object, but
becomes an imitation of another way of rendering such
objects.</p>

<p>Mr. Redgrave says that pictorial art in our manufactures
is one of our great mistakes. &ldquo;The picture
must be independent of the material, the thought alone
should govern it; whereas in decoration the material
must be one of the suggestors of the thought, its use
must govern the design.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps it will appear to my readers that here I
repeat, in different forms, what has been said in a
previous chapter on the history of <a href="#Page_14">style</a>. I think that
it is better to do so, than to omit to show where style and
design must accompany each other. Style, without any
reference to design, would be but a barren subject; and
design, without reference to style, would become lawless,
and soon be lost in the mazes of bad taste and mannerism.
Both subjects are of so large and important a nature that
I do not attempt to do more than point out how, in
their history and their influence, they belong to the craft
of embroidery.</p>

<p>Such influences belong to all art; and though I am
anxious to confine myself to only one section of it, I
find it difficult to resist the temptation to generalize and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
stray from the prescribed path, when large and important
views are opened on every side, as I travel on from
point to point.</p>

<p>In sketching the history of design, as well as I may in
so short a space, it is only considered in the light in
which it illustrates our craft.</p>

<p>I repeat that the design should be informed by the motive
which suggested it, and by the need which has
called it forth; and it must be moulded to the space it
has to fill, and the position it will occupy. The design
must be modified into different outward forms, according
to whether it is to be fitted to the edge of a building
against the sky; to a high panelled wall; to be applied
as a frieze, or round the capital of a pillar; to the embroidered
cover of an altar, or the silken hangings of a
bed, or the framed flat spaces on the walls of a saloon.
In fact, &ldquo;intention,&rdquo; &ldquo;place,&rdquo; and &ldquo;shape&rdquo; are necessary
motives and limits to a flat design.</p>

<p>Leaving aside all architectural ornamentation, and
adhering only to my own subject, embroidery, I will
limit my observations to the three purposes here suggested.
Firstly, as the central effect of the holiest part
of a church; secondly, in the domestic and comfortable
room, to be adorned and made cheerful; and thirdly, as
decking the refined and gay saloon or banqueting-hall.</p>

<p>To the church we should devote the most splendid and
effective contrasts, to blaze unframed against dark empty
backgrounds, or amidst stone and marble decorations;
something set apart from its surroundings, and asserting
that separation, is the desirable effect to be attained.</p>

<p>A totally different set of rules come into play when we
have to select the decorations of a bedroom. Here a
background does not exist. We are surrounded by four
walls very near to the eye, so that perspectives are a
secondary interest, if indeed they can claim any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
consideration; severe and magnificent ornamentation is out
of place, except perhaps in that time-honoured institution&mdash;to
be found in every great house possessing a suite of
reception-rooms&mdash;the State bedroom, where the display
of hangings and embroideries was the first motive of
the decoration of the past, clothing and garnishing the
bare spaces on the lofty walls. Space and separateness
are not the object or aim of the bedroom of to-day; but
lightness, snugness, and cheerful comfort, with which the
design of the textile ornaments have much to do. This
will in a later chapter come under the head of <a href="#Page_280">furniture</a>.</p>

<p>For the saloon we may accept any splendour of rich
and costly design, and the variously shaped panels assist
in suggesting the form of the decoration. The plain or
moulded panels, called in Italian &ldquo;targhe,&rdquo; or shields,
seem to be descended from the actual shields of gold
which Solomon hung on the walls of the king&rsquo;s house
in the Forest of Lebanon.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The motive was apparently
Tyrian, and traces of it are also to be found in Assyrian
sculpture.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The practice of framing the design gives opportunities
for change of materials, colour, and pattern, permitting
the employment of different flat surfaces laid on each
other, and scope for endless enrichment; the framed
picture being, perhaps, the central culminating attraction,
crowning, as it were, the textile ornamentation.</p>

<p>I merely give these instances as illustrating the rule
that we have more than once laid down, that a design
cannot fitly be employed except in the position for which
the artist has composed it. I will, however, add that
though it is right to give due consideration to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
preparation of each work for its intended use, yet we
often have charming suggestions offered to us, by the
chance acquisition of a beautiful artistic specimen, which
finds its own place and accommodates itself to the
surrounding colours and forms. These are the happy
accidents of which the cultivated artistic eye takes
advantage, adding them to the experience which may
help those who are seeking for the rules of harmony and
contrast in design.</p>

<p>Research into the mysteries and principles of design
applies to woven arabesques and patterns, and must
include machine-made textile ornament, and all decorative
needlework. It is, in fact, the fabric for the
million which most especially needs the careful study
of guiding rules. When a plant sends forth hundreds
of winged, wind-blown seeds, like the thistle, it spreads
itself over wide fields, and is more mischievous than
a more noxious growth, such as the deadly nightshade,
which only drops an occasional berry into the earth. So
a common cheap chintz or carpet, with a poor, gaudy,
motiveless design, carries a bad style into thousands of
homes wherever our commerce extends; disgracing us,
while it corrupts the taste of other nations.</p>

<p>In addressing our young designers, I would remind
them that in art the race is not always to the strong.
Prudence and educated powers, thoughtfulness and study,
often carry us where unassisted and uncultivated genius
has signally failed. Even such facilities as are afforded
by the acquirement of freehand drawing, as taught in our
schools of art, are not to be despised. The workman
should thoroughly master his tools, or they will hamper
him. The first step towards design is that you should
learn to draw. After this, appreciation and observation
are necessary, and due balance in outline and colour
should be studied; and all this is as much needed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
drawing a pattern as in composing a picture. The difference
lies in our art being only decorative, wherein
beauty and fitness are to be remembered, and nothing
else; whereas the picture may have to record historical
facts, or to inspire poetical thoughts&mdash;to awe or to touch
the beholder. A decorative design is only asked to
delight him. Intelligent delight, however, can only be
evoked by intelligent art, and to this, decoration must be
subjected.</p>

The earliest art we know (the bone-scratching) is naturalistic and
imitative. We are unaware of any attempt at a pattern of the prehistoric
period. The lake cities are of so vague a date that their ornaments on
pottery are puzzling rather than instructive. The earliest Hellenic pottery
was scratched or painted. Cuttle-fish, repeated over and over again,
are among the earliest attempts at a pattern, by repetition of a natural
object. Naturalism soon fell into symbolism, which appropriated it
and all art, and the upheaval of a new culture was needed to lift it once
more into the region of individual creation. See Boyd Dawkins&rsquo;
&ldquo;Early Man in Britain;&rdquo; also General Pitt Rivers&rsquo;s Museum of Prehistoric
Art, lately presented to the University of Oxford.</p>

Now there is a point of view in which we may regard the imitative
art of all races, the most civilized as well as the most barbarous&mdash;in
reference to the power of correctly representing animal and vegetable
forms, such as they exist in nature. The perfection of such imitation
depends not so much on the manual dexterity of the artist as on his
intelligence and comprehension of the type of the essential qualities of
the form he desires to represent. See Ch. T. Newton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essays on Art

Chinese design shows naturalistic art arrested and perpetuated on
totally different principles. Their representations are all equally allied
to their art of picture-painting, whether on china with the brush, or
on textiles with the needle. The flatness of the picture is still preserved
by their ignorance of perspective. When they attempted
to express different distances, they did so by placing them one above
another, so that in reading the composition the eye first takes in the
distant horizon; next below it, the middle distance; and being thus
prepared, it comes down to the actual living foreground, on which
rests the dramatic action and interest addressed to the spectator. The
Chinese understood many of the secrets of art, yet never achieved
perspective.</p>

Marked outlines in embroidery add to the flatness, and enable us
to omit cast shadows. In this it differs entirely from pictorial art,

Semper&rsquo;s theory, already mentioned, is that textile design was certainly
flat; that it was the first form of decoration, and was followed by
bas-relief, which could not at once rid itself of the original motive.</p>

This idolatrous type was introduced into England by the Buccaneers,
and reflected on our carvings and embroideries of the time of James I.,
slightly modified by the Italian Renaissance of that period. As this
sort of vulgar ornamentation has once prevailed, let us protect ourselves
against its possible recurrence.</p>

While making this passing allusion to the theory that the origin of
all Gothic decoration is mainly founded on the motive of interlacing
stems and foliage, I wish to guard myself against being supposed in any
way to argue against other beginnings, whenever they can be proved.
I have said before that most decorations have a mixed ancestry. But
when I see single or clustered columns starting from the ground&mdash;spreading
at the base like the gnarled root, and growing till they
culminate in crowns of foliage, forming symmetrical capitals, like the
first clusters of leaves on a strong young sapling&mdash;then the branches
spreading and interlacing, only checked at equal intervals by a lovely
leaf or burgeon, till they meet in blossoms on the highest point of the
arch,&mdash;I cannot but adhere to the old idea that rows of trees meeting
overhead suggested Gothic ornament as well as Gothic Architecture.
The Spanish or Moresque Gothic was overloaded with leaves and
flowers, and the German Gothic was enriched with fantastic trees and
flowers, each according to its national taste and fashion. A Gothic
tree is a very conventional plant; and generally carries only one leaf
on each branch. I have given a specimen of archaic trees from the
Bayeux tapestry. They are typical of the Gothic botanical idea and
style down to the fourteenth century. (Fig. <a href="#fig13">13</a>.)</p>

<p>Nor is this interpretation of Gothic design other than a result of its
descent from the Egyptian ancestral motive, where the temple columns
represented the single stem of the lotus with one large blossom for its
capital, or else a bundle of stems of the lotus, palm, and convolvulus
flowering together into a beautiful cluster. Even the gigantic columns
of the great hyp&aelig;thral hall at Karnac are only a stupendous exaggeration
of the same stalk and flower motive. From these were derived
the forms of the early Greek column&mdash;soon enriched by substituting
the Acanthus for the Lotus, but often retaining the convolvulus.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>PATTERNS.</h3>


<p>In the last chapter on <a href="#Page_54">design</a> I have described patterns
as the examples or illustrations of the art of decoration,
and as being the records of the motives which produced
them in different eras. My present object is to class
and define patterns as decorative art.</p>

<p>It is argued by some arch&aelig;ologists that the recurrence of
a pattern, for instance the &ldquo;wave,&rdquo; over the whole world,
proves that it really came from many sources, under the
same conditions of life and art; showing also that a
pattern is a thing that, like a flower, must grow, if the
culture of the race be equal. I do not believe this.
We can nearly always trace the family history of a
pattern to its original motive; and in the very few cases
where we are unable to do so, it is hardly necessary to
cover our ignorance by stretching the fashionable theory
of development over the few instances that are as yet
unaccountable.</p>

<p>I have been repeatedly asked to procure or to invent
a new pattern. Such is my respect for the decorative
achievement called a &ldquo;pattern,&rdquo; that I cannot hope for
the moment of inspiration in which I might create such
a thing. If any one has in his lifetime invented a
pattern, he has done something truly remarkable, and as
rare as is a really original thought on any subject.
Patterns are commonly, like men, the result of many
centuries of long descent from ancestors of remote
antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
Individuals differ from their ancestors through inherited
and surrounding conditions, and through the
modifying powers of evolution, climate, and education.
So also a pattern has, besides its ancestry and descent,
the unconscious mark or seal of its day; and it is easy to
trace whence it comes, if we set ourselves to examine the
style of it seriously.</p>

<p>The patterns of which we can nearly always name at
once the nationality, are the Assyrian, the Chinese,
the Egyptian, the Hindu (Aryan and Turanian), the
Persian, the Archaic and the highly developed Grecian;
the Roman, the Celtic, the Byzantine, the Arabian, the
Gothic, the Renaissance, the Spanish Pl&acirc;teresque, the
Louis Quatorze, and those of the art of Central America.</p>

<p>The pattern cannot exist without design. Design
means intention and motive. Many of the motives in
Oriental textile decorations are suggestive of intention,
as is shown by their names. Among Indian patterns we
meet with &ldquo;ripples of silver,&rdquo; &ldquo;sunshine and shade,&rdquo;
&ldquo;pigeon&rsquo;s eye,&rdquo; &ldquo;peacock&rsquo;s neck,&rdquo; &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Patterns must be classed either by their dates, when
ascertained, or according to their style, which must generally
be allowed to cover vast areas and periods irregularly
drifting down, overlapping, or being absorbed or effaced
by the circumstances they have encountered.</p>

<p>Only when a national style has been obstinately fixed,
as in China, and bound down by strict laws and religious
formulas, suited exactly to the people for whom they
were evolved out of the national life, and imprinted on
it by their own lawgivers, philosophers, and priests;
and neither imposed by conquerors, nor swept over by
the waves of a new civilization;&mdash;only in such cases can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
we find a continuity of decorative art which leads us far
back on its traces. Then, on this long track, we learn
how little, man, the decorating animal, has really advanced
in his powers of creation. He has gone more than once
to a certain point, and has then either been petrified by
law and custom&mdash;turned into a pillar of salt, like Lot&rsquo;s
wife, because he has looked back instead of striving to
advance, or else through poverty or satiety has fallen into
the last stage of the Seven Ages, &ldquo;<i>sans</i> eyes, <i>sans</i> teeth&mdash;<i>sans</i>
everything.&rdquo; When what is good is neither
perceived nor desired, then the arts, small and great,
dwindle and disappear, and nothing remains to show that
they have been, but a name, and perhaps a pattern.</p>

<p>Chinese design is the most striking example of the
first of these phases; and the extinction of all classical
art with the fall of Paganism in Rome is an instance of
the second.</p>

<p>In the chapter on <a href="#Page_14">style</a> it is said that a pattern is
as ineffaceable as a word. But one will occasionally
disappear for a time, till the ruin that covers it is cleared
away, and the lost design recovered and employed simply
as a decoration, if it is beautiful; or perhaps fitted with
a new meaning, and so it makes a fresh start.</p>

<p>The importance of patterns, when traceable to their
origin, as a means of investigating historical influences
cannot be too much insisted on, and their history is
full of suggestion as a guide to the decorator. Much
has been argued and much ascertained from the evidence
of these fragments of national civilizations, showing how
an idea or a myth has been, as it were, engrafted into the
essence of another national idea, partly altering what it
finds, and changing to fit itself to its new surroundings.
Eastern patterns have travelled far, and lasted long; and
continue still to hold the fancy, and exercise the ingenuity,
of the artist and decorator. When we find a pattern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
of which the nationality is strongly marked, it is worth
our while to ascertain its date and history, which will help
us to recognize cognate design wherever we may meet it.
However, this is often not to be done; and then it is
best to set these puzzling examples aside, and to await
patiently the elucidation, which may come from some
source of which we are as yet ignorant.</p>

<p>In very early art we have little remaining but patterns,
on which we may found theories by tracing them home
to their original source. The oldest patterns had each
a meaning and an intention. When a pattern has been
enduring and far spread, it is because it was originally
the expression of an idea or a symbol.</p>

<p>In the earliest dawn of civilization, the arts were the
repositories of the myths and mysteries of national
faiths. Embroidery was one of these arts, and the border
which edged the garment of a divinity, the veil which
covered the grave of a loved one, or the flower-buds and
fruit which fringed the hangings and curtains in the
sanctuary, each had a meaning, and therefore a use.
These symbolical designs and forms were constantly reproduced;
and all human ingenuity was exercised in
reforming, remodelling, and adding perfect grace to the
expression of the same idea.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Patterns may be ranged under four heads&mdash;the
Primitive, the Naturalistic, the Conventional, and the
Geometrical.</p>

<p>The primitive are those of which we know not the
ancestry, and rarely can guess the motive. To us they
are, in general, simply rude decorations. The naturalistic
are those which are borrowed from natural forms, and are
either only imitative, or else convey some hidden meaning.
The conventional are those which, by long descent, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
come to be accepted simply as ornamental art, with or
without reference to an original motive, now lost. The
geometrical or symmetrical are founded on form only, and
in so far resemble our experience of the primitive; they
express no meaning, and only serve to satisfy the eye by
their balance and their ingenuity.</p>


<h4>PRIMITIVE.</h4>

<p>The first patterned forms with which we are acquainted
are the primitive. They are found in all parts of the
inhabited world. In our present ignorance as to the
beginnings of the scattered tribes of men, we cannot
judge if these are the remains of an earlier art or the first
germs of a new one. Of one thing there is no doubt:
this primitive decoration consists entirely of pattern; that
is to say, of the repetition of certain (to us) inexpressive
forms, which by reiteration assume importance and in
some degree express beauty&mdash;the beauty of what Monsieur
Blanc calls &ldquo;cadence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After these first unintelligible forms, which simply by
repetition become accepted patterns, come those called
the Prehistoric, of which we know or guess something
as to their original meaning, and which, having been
reduced from the hieroglyphic-symbolical to the conventional,
have thus crystallized themselves, by constant
use, into a pattern. Such, for instance, is the simplest
form of the &ldquo;wave&rdquo; pattern, which in very early art was
a representation of water.</p>

<p>The prehistoric water or wave patterns had other
forms; for instance, zigzags, upright or horizontal, and
undulating lines which are intelligible as expressing
smooth or rough water. In general, however, the primitive
and prehistoric patterns convey no idea, and consist,
as we have said elsewhere, of lines, straight or wavy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
sometimes intersected; of angles, zigzags, groups of
dots, rings and little discs, and crosses of the Swastika
shape. (Plate <a href="#pl10">10</a>.)</p>

<p>Where shall the tartan be placed? It is certainly
primitive, and apparently had no intention beyond that
of employing as many coloured threads as there were dyes,
so as to form the brightest contrasts, or else to be as
invisible as possible either in the sunshine or in the shade.
The Gauls brought this kind of weaving with them from
the East, and probably invented the pattern, if such
a motiveless design can be so called. It had its classical
name, &ldquo;Polymita,&rdquo; and was admired in Rome when newly
imported, as being something original and barbaric.
The Romans found it in Britain, and Boadicea wore a
tartan dress on the day of her defeat. Perhaps even then
fashions came from France, and it may have been her
best tunic from across the Channel. This fabric may
have been imported by the Belgic Gauls, and was so
easily woven on house looms, that it became in time the
feudal dress of the Scottish tribes and clans, and the
colours were ingeniously arranged to show the most
different effects. The tartan has always been a resource
for the woollen trade, and the fashion constantly recurs
in France, either from sentiment or the actually inherited
Gallic taste; but it remains a primitive pattern, and
nothing can make it artistic. No embroidery can soften
the constantly recurring angles, and only fringes can be
employed to decorate a tartan costume. Pliny tells us of
the ingenuity of Zeuxis, who, to show his wealth, had his
name embroidered in gold in the squared compartments
of his outer garment.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Primitive patterns still linger in many savage nations,
but especially throughout uncivilized Africa. Curious to
say, the very ancient fossilized early art of Egypt does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
not assist us to trace it back to a prehistoric style, though
it may lead us into prehistoric times.</p>


<h4>NATURALISTIC.</h4>

<p>The phases of the naturalistic patterns are constantly
recurring. Art is always tending to realism, in the
laudable effort to reach the motive without the shackles
of rules. Each phase has fallen a prey to symbolism,
to conventionalism, or to mannerism, which last symptom
marks the decline and fall of art. We shall find these
phases everywhere in the design of patterns.</p>

<p>Naturalism has always striven, by simple repetition, to
reduce to patterns the forms of flowers, fruits, animals,
birds, insects, reptiles, and other natural objects.</p>

<p>In flower patterns the simplest forms by repetition make
sometimes the richest patterns, and the most effective.
(Plate <a href="#pl11">11</a>, Nos. 1 and 2.)</p>

<p>It is remarkable that one very beautiful class of
natural objects is rarely employed in ancient decoration<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>&mdash;shells
and corals. The barbarous tribes of the West
Coast of Africa alone seem to have appreciated their
forms, and added them to their small repertory of
naturalistic patterns. They do not appear in any
European or Asiatic textiles till the seventeenth century,
when shells were much used in the decorations of the
reigns of Queen Anne and Louis Quatorze.</p>

<p>The first change from naturalism into the conventional
was through symbolism, and belonged to the time when
unwritten thought was first recorded by pictured signs,
which then ceased to be merely decoration. We find
that the naturalism of the earliest Egyptians and Asiatics
was soon entirely absorbed by the effort to express some
hidden meaning or mystery, and then to fit the representation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
to a special place and purpose, and to restore it,
as it were, to decorative art.</p>

<p>The lotus and the patterns founded on its forms, and
the many emblematic meanings attached to them, are
notable examples of these transmutations in style and
intention, and of the value given to their intention and
use in Egypt and India, where each development was
immediately crystallized into a recognized pattern, and
given its place and language. It received its &ldquo;<i>mot
d&rsquo;ordre</i>,&rdquo; and continued to act upon it long after the
meaning was forgotten or out of date.</p>

<p>The rolling pattern which had so long represented
only the &ldquo;wave,&rdquo; was given to the really straight stem
of the lotus, and its blossom, substituted for the wave&rsquo;s
crest, now filled many a frieze in Indian temple architecture;
whereas the lotus stems in Egypt were still
bound in sheaves to form columns, and the flowers, buds,
and leaves spread and blossomed into capitals. Here
we have symbolism and conventionalized naturalism, all
combined, showing how their principles, though quite
distinct, can mix and unite. The conventional form often
superseded and effaced the naturalistic, and became the
sign of an idea, or the hieroglyphic picture of a thing;
immovable and unalterable in Egypt, where every effort
was made to secure eternity on earth, but continually
returning to naturalism in India, where the Aryan tendency,
with the assistance of the &ldquo;Code of Manu,&rdquo; always
recurred to the restoration of the ancient naturalistic
motive.</p>

<p>In the India Museum we may see the &ldquo;wave&rdquo; motive
converted into a lotus pattern by rolling the long stems,
and filling up the spaces between with the full-faced
blossom. Sometimes the pattern is started by the figure

of the sun proceeds. This occurs so often that it must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
originally have had a meaning. Sometimes the sacred
convolvulus takes the place of the lotus. (Plate <a href="#pl12">12</a>.)</p>

<p>On an Egyptian mural painting are seen parties of
men snaring ducks among papyrus and lotus plants.
These are entirely conventional, and are, in fact, a sort of
recognized hieroglyphic representing the idea of a lotus.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>The lotus was the accepted emblem of the sun, and
reduced to a many-leaved radiating pattern may be found
as an architectural ornament on the outside of the Buddhist
&ldquo;topes,&rdquo; of which the models are on the staircase of the
British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> (Plate <a href="#pl13">13</a>.)</p>

<p>We have Sir G. Birdwood&rsquo;s authority for believing
that, though the actual lotus was a native of India, and
carried thence to Egypt, its decorative use as a pattern
was Egyptian, and so returned to India. Both accepted
it as their &ldquo;sunflower.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Can it be our Aryan descent which induces in us the
earnest adoration, in our art of to-day, of our northern
prototype of the sun&rsquo;s emblem? I fear that we must
acknowledge that our &aelig;sthetic worship of our sunflowers
is somewhat false and affected. &AElig;stheticism is not art.
Sunflowers, painted or embroidered as decoration, do
not &ldquo;take&rdquo; if they are ordered and ranged, and reduced
to a pattern like those of Egypt. They must be
naturalistic, and, if possible, remind us of a disorderly
cottage garden; whereas in India they were adapted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
from nature on fixed principles, which immediately reduced
them to the conventional.</p>

<p>I have given this account of the patterns founded
on the lotus, as we can almost from this distance of time
take a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of its rise in naturalism, its spread,
dispersion, and its crystallization into conventional forms;
also we can trace how the lotus patterns of Indian
art have resulted, when accepted in Europe, in nothing
but the rolling wave, carrying flower forms which no
longer represent a lotus; and how the lotus bud and
flower pattern has become in time the classical &ldquo;egg
and tongue;&rdquo; which, however, may have resulted also
from a combination of other motives.</p>

<p>Representations of animal forms are sometimes very
remarkable in phases of naturalism. The few remains of
Celtic art that have survived are entirely animal, or very
nearly so. In their stone, gold, silver, and bronze work,
and in illuminated MSS., we meet with only animal
forms; never a flower or a leaf.</p>

<p>Besides the Indo-Chinese patterns in Celtic art, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
suggest the Chinese lattice-work (so strongly insisted on
by Semper as a constant motive), we also find in all their
decorations compartments containing involved patterns
of cords or strings knitted or plaited, suggesting the
entrails of animals, which by these hunting people were
consulted as being mysteriously prophetic of approaching
events, especially success or failure in the chase, and
impending warlike raids.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> There is no other way of accounting
for these designs, which are peculiar to the race,
unless we believe they always represent snakes. (Pl. <a href="#pl15">15</a>.)</p>

<p>In England much that was characteristic of the style
was lost as soon as the Saxons drove out the Celts, who
carried it to Ireland, as may be seen in the Book of Kells,
and the carving of the Harp of Tara, and the Celtic
jewels in the Irish museums; but the interlacing patterns
survived throughout Anglo-Saxon art, and were marvellously
ingenious and beautiful; witness the Durham Book
of St. Cuthbert.</p>

<p>We have no Celtic textiles remaining to us, unless
some embroidery in the Marien-Kirche collection at
Dantzic may be of that style and time. This is suggested
by its altogether Indo-Chinese and very barbarous
character;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and one of the coronation mantles in Bock&rsquo;s

<p>Representations of human figures in embroideries
probably originated in hangings for the wall; but have
been treated as decorative forms, both by the Indians
and the Greeks, for wearing apparel. The peplos of
Minerva was bordered with fighting gods and giants,
and the Empress Theodora&rsquo;s dress in the Ravenna mosaic
repeats exactly the same motive. (See Fig. <a href="#fig04">4</a>, and Pl. <a href="#pl06">6</a>.)</p>

<p>There are two other examples of such Greek patterns.
The mantle of Demeter on a Greek vase in the British
Museum, of the best period (Pl. <a href="#pl16">16</a>), is embroidered with
flying genii and victorious chariots; and the embroidered
mantle lately found in a Crimean tomb, is of precisely the
same style of design, and the one illustrates the other.
These instances are so exceptional, that it is curious that
here, as in the case of the peplos, in each case there should
happen to be a duplicate. (Plates <a href="#pl16">16</a> and <a href="#pl17">17</a>, No. 1.)</p>

<p>In Babylonian, Assyrian, and Chaldean art we constantly
find animal forms in patterns. The lion and the
hare, birds and insects, are the commonest; and there are
some instances of human figures reduced to a pattern in
these sculptured representations of textiles. (Plate <a href="#pl02">2</a>.)</p>

<p>There are curiously woven little human figures finished
with the needle on the sleeve of an Egyptian dress in the
British Museum, from Saccarah (Pl. <a href="#pl18">18</a>), and, of course,
when such a design is small, it ceases to be very objectionable.
On the whole, however, naturalistic designs
for embroideries are more safely confined to floral decorations,
excepting always flat tapestries for walls,
which, representing pictures, may be as naturalistic as
their purpose and style will admit.</p>

<p>Animal forms are often reduced to patterns by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
repetition in Indian and Persian embroidery.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The drawing
is naturalistic, but the colouring is fanciful. We may
see any day, on Persian rugs, scarlet lions pursuing and
capturing blue or yellow hares. The flatness and want
of all shadows tends to the conventional. Lions, bulls,
cats, beetles, and serpents abound especially in Egyptian
design; insects, reptiles, and fish in Asiatic patterns,
where animals are sometimes made to walk in pairs, with
their heads and tails twisted into a pattern.</p>

<p>Though landscapes are so rarely worked that the
subject is, perhaps, hardly worthy of notice, yet such mistaken
specimens of ingenuity have occurred. An altar
frontal was exhibited at Zurich, in 1883, containing some
really exquisitely worked landscapes, which were quite
out of place, both as art and as decoration, for an ecclesiastical
purpose. This was of the beginning of the last
century.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>While we appreciate and should take advantage of our
national tendency to naturalistic design, we must beware
of looking on fixed rules as bonds which cramp our
liberty, and of thinking that nature should be our only
guide to an otherwise unassisted and unfettered inspiration.
Without the wholesome checks of experience
and educated taste, and the knowledge which teaches us
what to avoid, as well as what to imitate, founded on
the successes and failures of others, we fall into weak
imitations of natural objects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
Mr. Redgrave points out how unpleasant and jarring
to our sense of what is appropriate, and therefore how
offensive to good taste and common sense, it is to tread
on a carpet of water-lilies swimming in blue pools, or
on fruits and flowers heaped up and casting shadows
probably towards the light.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Woollen lions and tigers,
as large as life, basking before the fire in a wreath of
roses, are alarming rather than agreeable, and are of the
nature of a practical joke in art. It is the search for
novelty in naturalism that leads to such astonishing
compositions; and these, being successively rejected in
the heart of our civilization and culture, are drifted away
to vulgarize our colonies, or to be sold cheap to furnish
Continental hotels, and make the English traveller blush
for his home manufactures.</p>


<h4>SYMBOLICAL AND CONVENTIONAL.</h4>

<p>Though it is true that the highest art, pictorial and
sculptural, is always struggling towards naturalism, the
art of decoration is, by its nature, constantly tending to
conventionalism. Patterns, if not absolutely geometrical
or naturalistic, must be classed under this principle. Let
us examine what is meant by a conventional pattern.</p>

<p>It may be said that the conventional includes every
form&mdash;the symbolic, the naturalistic, or even the hieroglyphic&mdash;that
is selected and consecrated to convey a
certain idea. The lily of Florence, which is something
between a lily and an iris, but unlike either, is a conventional
form; likewise the lily of France, which it is said
was once a conventional frog. The rose of England,
the shamrock, and the thistle have always been more
naturalistic than is usual in such heraldic designs; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
the parti-coloured rose of York and Lancaster was
decidedly conventional, and heraldic.</p>

<p>Conventional patterns now are those which, having been
originally naturalistic in style, but perhaps emblematic
as to their motive, have been repeated till the meaning
and form have been lost; or else, as in the case of the
lotus, the emblem is forgotten, and nothing remains but
the recognized conventional form.</p>

<p>One conventional pattern which, having commenced
by being a symbol, has been repeated and varied till it
has allowed the original essential meaning to escape, is
the &ldquo;palm-leaf&rdquo; or &ldquo;cone&rdquo; pattern on French or Paisley
shawls, which, having been a sacred emblem&mdash;the tree of
life&mdash;in Persia, became in Europe, when the religious
myth was lost, only a shawl pattern&mdash;merely a leaf, with
plant painted within its outlines. (Plate <a href="#pl23">23</a>, Nos. 10, 11.)</p>

<p>Decorative designs become conventional in spite of
the intention of the designer. He is overruled by the
spaces to be covered and the materials to be employed.
His design must produce a flat pattern; he must repeat
it again and again; he must give it a strong outline; he
must distribute it regularly at certain intervals. Repetition
at once conventionalizes the most naturalistic
drawing, and the most sacred and mysterious emblem.
Alternation is equally a source of conventionalism. There
is no motive that cannot be conventionalized into a
pattern by repetition. A Gothic crown and a true lily,
repeated, will make an ecclesiastical conventional pattern.
Then come all the Arabian and Moresque forms (which
are mostly geometric), and also the Gothic (which are
partly geometric and partly naturalistic, especially those
in German and debased Spanish and Portuguese Gothic
design).</p>

<p>Then we must accept as conventional all those which
may be called kaleidoscope patterns, which are broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
fragments of old motives, repeated or &ldquo;radiated&rdquo; so as to
become partly geometrical, wholly conventional. (See Pl.
<a href="#pl17">17</a>, No. 2.)</p>

<p>Conventional patterns may be reduced into three kinds.</p>

<p>First, the naturalistic, which have by repetition been
adapted for decorative art.</p>

<p>Secondly, the symbolical&mdash;Pagan or Christian, religious
or historical, including the Heraldic.</p>

<p>Thirdly, those conventional forms which may never
have had any inner meaning, or else, having originally
had one, have lost it.</p>

<p>All these exist, sometimes apart and sometimes
mingled; so that some thought must be expended in
seeking the motive which has brought them together,
and finding in each the internal evidence of its descent.</p>

<p>It is evident that patterns, conventionalized and brought
from distant sources, sometimes meet and amalgamate.
When the origin of a conventional pattern is disputed,
it is worth while to examine if it has a double parentage.
Let me give, as an instance, the key pattern. It may
have been, as Semper believes, originally Chinese, and
derived from wicker-work design. It represents also
the broken or dislocated &ldquo;wave,&rdquo; the symbol of the River
M&aelig;ander,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and for water generally. We find it everywhere
in company with the wave, which never could
have had any connection with wicker-work, not only
in China, but in Persia, India, Egypt, Arabia, Greece,
Rome, and Central America. (Pl. <a href="#pl19">19</a>.)</p>

<p>Can any invention of man show a more symbolical
intention than the wave pattern? The airy leap drawn
downwards by the force of gravitation; controlled, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
again made to return, but strong to insist on its own
curve of predilection, rushing back under the same circle;
strengthened by the downward movement to spring again
from its original plane; beginning afresh its Sisyphus
labour, and facing the next effort with the same grace
and agility. Undying force, and
eternal flowing unrest&mdash;these are
the evident intention and symbol
of the wave pattern. Though I believe
the key pattern to be a modification of the wave
form, yet the locking and unlocking movement suggests
a repetition of the Tau, or key of life.</p>

<p>When we admire the friezes of garlands hung between
the skulls of oxen and goats, we cannot for a moment
doubt the sacrificial idea on which the design was
founded. When the wreaths are carried by dancing
children, we recognize the impersonation of the rejoicing
of the d&aelig;dal earth.</p>

<p>The Greeks, however strongly they exerted themselves
to throw off the shackles of conventionality in sculpture,
painting, and architecture, yet yielded to the traditional
force of the symbolical pattern, and accepted most of
the Oriental forms, merely remodelling them for their
own use, and adding to their significance what their culture
required; at the same time giving infinite variety,
as their perfect taste dictated.</p>

of art throws a gleam of inner light on the struggle
towards originality and truth which characterized the
Greek principles of beauty and fitness in literature and
art, in direct contrast to that which was always turning
back to those fossil forms which were only respectable
on account of their age and their mystery, but of which
the tradition and intention were already lost.</p>

<p>Roman patterns were merely Greek adaptations with an
Etruscan flavour, which was a survival of the earliest
Italian art. Perhaps the indigenous element had been
already modified by Ph&oelig;nician influence.</p>

<p>In taking stock of Oriental symbolical patterns, we
find that one of those of the widest ancestry and
longest continuity is the &ldquo;Sacred Hom.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> (Pl. <a href="#pl20">20-24</a>.)

Greek, and Roman art; and consequently it prevails in
all European decoration (except the Gothic), where it
was reduced to unrecognizable forms.</p>

<p>Sir George Birdwood says the Hom or Homa was
the Sanskrit Soma, used as an intoxicating drink by the
early Brahmins, and was extracted from the plant of
that name, an almost leafless succulent Asclepiad. It
appears to have changed its conventional form as other
plants by fermentation came to the front, containing
what appeared to be the &ldquo;spirit of life&rdquo;&mdash;the <i>aqua vit&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
The palm, with its wonderful fruit, which is convertible

from the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> It is a good example of the

<p>This sacred tree, the Homa of Zoroaster and of the
later Persians, has so early a beginning that we find it
on Assyrian monuments.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Rock says &ldquo;that, perhaps, it
stood for the tree of life, which grew in Paradise.&rdquo; It
is represented as a subject of homage to men and animals,
and it invariably stands between priests and kings, or
beasts kneeling to it. It is figured on the small bucket
for religious rites, carried in the hands, or embroidered
in the upper sleeve of the monarch&rsquo;s tunic. It always
represents a shrub, sometimes bearing a series of umbels
of seven flowers each. (Pl. <a href="#pl02">2</a>, <a href="#pl20">20</a>.)</p>

<p>Sometimes the expression of the symbol is reduced to
the cone-fruit of the homa alone; or even to a blossom,
as in the two glass bowls in the Slade collection in the
British Museum, from a tomb at Chiusi, in Etruria. Here
the design is a flower, of which each petal contains the
essential emblem&mdash;a plant within a plant. These bowls,
pronounced to be Greek of the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>, have
yet to me a strong Oriental character. (Pl. <a href="#pl22">22</a>, No. 3.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
I have spoken of the lotus as a naturalistic pattern.
One mode of drawing and embroidering its flower in India,
is to cut it in two; half the blossom is then carefully
and almost botanically copied, thus conveying the inner
meaning of the sacred flower. (Pl. <a href="#pl22">22</a>, No. 3.)</p>

<p>Another conventional pattern, common to all times of
art and all nations, is that called in architecture the &ldquo;egg
and tongue&rdquo; pattern. (Pl. <a href="#pl13">13</a>.) This, as I have already
said, is supposed to be derived directly from the lotus.
The Egyptians formed it from the bud and blossom; and
the pattern is found in India, Greece, and Rome, changing
continually and yet retaining its identity. Vitruvius
claimed to have given it the last touch and finish, so that
in Italy it was called the Vitruvian scroll; and it is
common to all decoration, even in textiles, though it is
hardly suited for weaving or embroidery. This is one
of the earliest patterns which, having ceased long ago
to be a religious emblem or sign, still survives by its
decorative fitness, and perpetuates the echoes of its
origin.</p>

<p>Of the conventional symbolical forms of the early
Christian Church I shall speak more fully in the
chapter on <a href="#Page_303">ecclesiastical art</a>, and therefore would only
point out here, while touching on symbolical decoration,
how that phase of Christian art is a great historical
instance of the deep ancient meanings it illustrates;
showing the motive to be often in accordance with the
inherited pagan symbol, and yet differing from it. Pre-eminent
among these is the emblem of the Cross, so early
and universally used, full of mysterious secret allusions
to the groping faiths of idolatrous nations, before the
great fundamental idea of the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; was attached to
it. This was one of the old signs used as a pattern, and
transfigured into a fresh type, of which the radiance
reflected back light upon all that preceded it, even as

<p class="caphang">1. Pallas Athene, from a vase in Lord Northampton&rsquo;s Collection.
2. Ajax in a cloak embroidered with swastika, sun cross, and
prehistoric water patterns. Etruscan Museum. Vatican.</p>

<p>The cross (Pl. <a href="#pl25">25</a>), was a sign and a pattern in prehistoric
art. It was the double of the Tau, the Egyptian
emblem of life; and while the Jews reject the Christian
cross, they still claim to have warned off the destroying
angel by this sign in blood over the lintels of their
doors in the first Passover.</p>

<p>But the most ancient and universal form of the cross
is that of the Swastika, or Fylfote. This &ldquo;prehistoric
cross&rdquo; is said to be formed of two fire-sticks, belonging to
the ancient worship of the sun, laid across each other
ready for friction; but losing that meaning, from an
emblem they fell into a pattern, and this you will still
find, utterly meaningless, on Persian carpets of to-day.</p>

<p>Sir G. Birdwood gives the Swastika as the sectarial
mark of the Sakti sects in India. Fergusson names it
with the mound buildings, as belonging to all Buddhist
art; and examples of the Swastika are to be found on
Rhodian pottery from the Necropolis of Kamiros, where
we find also the key pattern.</p>

<p>In early Greek art the Swastika and Gammadion are
everywhere, especially as embroidery on dress. Minerva&rsquo;s
petticoats are sometimes worked all over with the latter.
On an early Greek vase in the Museo Gregoriano,
are painted Ajax and Achilles playing at dice; and the
mantle of Ajax is squared into an embroidered pattern
that alternately represents a sun or star and a Gammadion
(Pl. <a href="#pl26">26</a>, No. 2). But it is unnecessary to multiply
classical examples, which are endless.</p>

<p>The Christian Cross was often formed by converting
the Tau into the Gamma, the sacred letter of the Greeks.
It is said to have been the emblem of the corner-stone,
and as a pattern, was called, down to the thirteenth
century, the &ldquo;Gammadion;&rdquo; and though it had lost its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
original motive, it continued to preserve the idea of a
secret and mystical meaning.</p>

<p>The Gammadion, as well as the Swastika, enters largely
into the illuminations of the Celtic Book of Kells and
those of the Lindisfarne MSS.; also it is to be found on
the Celtic shields in the British Museum, together with
the Swastika. Both appear in the Persian carpets of
to-day, and as patterns were, in ecclesiastical decoration,
employed down to the fifteenth century, both for European
and British textiles. The Swastika, as well as the wave
pattern, is of mysterious and universal antiquity, and has
certainly traversed four thousand years,&mdash;how much more
we dare not say. It is to be found throughout Egyptian
and Indian art&mdash;never in
that of Assyria.</p>

<p>We know something of the
conventional and symbolical embroideries
of Nineveh, which are quite unlike those of
India, except in the adoption of the lotus for decoration.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
These are best understood by illustrations; and, therefore,
I give one of the beautiful sculptured carpets from
Nineveh, in the British Museum (Pl. <a href="#pl27">27</a>), showing the
Assyrian use of the lotus and cone, and the embroidered
garment of a king from one of the sculptures in low
relief (Plate <a href="#pl01">1</a>). These are very stately&mdash;perfectly
conventional and decorative; and we feel that they have
grown where we find them, and are not borrowed from
another civilization. What strikes us most, is the constant
repetition and the little variety of ornament in
these patterns. The forms are strongly marked&mdash;wheels
or whorls, or daisies, often repeated. (The daisy
belongs to Assyria as the lotus to Egypt.) The flowers
are simply leafless blossoms. Splendid embroideries of
sacred emblematical designs are, however, occasionally
found, such as those from Layard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monuments&rdquo;
(Plate <a href="#pl02">2</a>).</p>

<p>Much has been written on the early symbolism of
plants and flowers. The sun-myths have enlisted all
floral legendary lore, and conventional ornament was
largely drawn from them.</p>

<p>Many symbols are present to us when we name
certain plants. The lily is the acknowledged sign of
purity, the rose of love, the honeysuckle of enduring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
faith, the laurel of poetry, and the palm of victory;
the oak of strength, the olive of peace. Some plants
have accumulated more than one meaning. The vine
has many attributes. It is an emblem of the mysteries
of the Christian Church. It symbolizes plenty, joy, the
family. Ivy means friendship, conviviality, remembrance.</p>

<p>The symbolism of beasts (<i>bestiaria</i>),<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> of birds (<i>volucraria</i>),
and of stones (<i>lapidaria</i>) filled many volumes in the
medi&aelig;val ages, and are well worthy of the study of the
decorative artist. The symbolism of animals and birds
especially, constantly attracts our attention in the Oriental
and Sicilian textiles of the early Christian times, and to
the end of the thirteenth century. Later, in European
textile decoration, most animals were accepted as emblematic
in Christian art, beginning with the symbols of
the four Evangelists. All the virtues and all the vices
found their animal emblems conventionalized, and were
thus woven, embroidered, and painted.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Reptiles and insects are included under the head of
&ldquo;beasts,&rdquo; and perhaps fishes also. Each was dowered
with a symbolical meaning; and thus admitted into art,
they were conventionalized by being strongly outlined,
coloured flat; and by repetition without variation, were
converted into patterns.</p>

<p>When the use of heraldic illustration was added to the
already accepted symbolism, animal decoration became
very common, and soon forgot its symbolical motives,
which were succeeded by Renaissance fanciful patterns;
and then the conventionalized beast and its symbolism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
disappeared from European decoration, except when it
was a direct copy of an Oriental design.</p>

<p>Certain symbolical forms have, however, survived. The
eagle has always meant empire, and the double-headed
eagle, a double royalty.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Ezekiel represents Babylon
and Egypt, symbolically, as two eagles.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> But here
we approach the subject of heraldry, which became a
science in medi&aelig;val days; and every man and woman
in any way remarkable, every chivalrous action and
national event, became a subject for textile art, and was
woven or worked with the needle on banner, hanging,
or dress. The altar decorations received a new stimulus
as historical records, as well as religious symbols, and
pride and piety were equally enlisted in these gifts to the
Church.</p>

<p>Byzantine patterns have a barbaric stamp, and yet
have much of the grandiose about them; but they are
to the last degree conventional. In the early mosaics,
both in Constantinople and Rome, every face and head,
every flower and animal, represents a type and not an
individual.</p>

<p>Gothic foliage patterns, in England and elsewhere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
are a struggle between the naturalistic and the conventional.
The Norman style and the Romanesque, which
preceded it, and from which it was modified and elevated,
show their vegetable forms thick-stemmed and few-leaved,
whereas the Gothic aspired to a developed gracefulness;
and the Renaissance, which succeeded it, assumed
all the freedom of natural flowers and plants, floating in
the breeze, on their delicate stems. (Pl. <a href="#pl28">28</a>.)</p>

<p>All the Renaissance patterns, which, as their name
denotes, were born again, like butterflies to frolic for a
day of gay enjoyment, are purely decorative. Their
generally charming, graceful forms group together to
cover empty spaces with every regard to the rules of
design and composition, but without any inner meaning.
If we take these arabesques to pieces, we generally find
the parts come from various sources; and having served
last in pagan Rome for pagan purposes, had been
slightly refashioned for Christian decorative art,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> before
the Byzantine inartistic taste, and barbaric splendour of
metal-work patterns, had extinguished all the gay fancy
of the arts of Southern Europe.</p>

<p>The medi&aelig;val revival was a return to the light and
fantastic, and a protest against the solemnity of all Gothic
art, which had had its great day, had culminated, and died
out. The patterns of the Renaissance are all guided by
the principles of repetition and duplication, or that of
doubling the pattern, which repeats itself to right and left,
as if folded down the middle.</p>

<p>The principal lines thus echoed one another; but the
artist was permitted to vary the conventionalism of the
general forms of figures, flowers, fruit, or butterflies, so
as to balance and yet differ in every detail.</p>

particular symbolical meaning being attached to them,
we must instance those derived from the Cloud pattern.
This is to be found in early Chinese and Indian art, but
I do not recognize it in Egyptian or Greek decoration.
It came through Byzantium, and took its place amongst
early Christian patterns. (Pl. <a href="#pl29">29</a>.)</p>

<p>The cloud pattern is also Japanese, and is supposed to
have been originally derived from Central Asia. It varies
in shape, and is found as an ornament on the head of
the sceptre in the collection at Nara, in Japan, which is
twelve or thirteen hundred years old. There is an
example of the cloud pattern in Aelfled&rsquo;s embroidery at
Durham; and it is often found under the feet of saints in
painted glass and embroideries before the fourteenth
century. A curious Indian example exists in a coverlet
belonging to the Marquis of Salisbury, said to have been
the property of Oliver Cromwell, on which the central
medallion is filled with white horses careering amidst the
cloud pattern.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> (Pl. <a href="#pl30">30</a>.)</p>

<p>The <em>netted</em> pattern called Fundata is extremely ancient.
We find it in Egyptian mural paintings, as well as in
the centre of a Ph&oelig;nician bowl from Cyprus, now in
the Louvre. The medi&aelig;val Fundata was a silk material,
covered with what appeared to be a gold network
covering the stuff. It is supposed to be the same as
that worn by Constantine,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and is named in ecclesiastical
inventories as late as the fifteenth century. (Pl. <a href="#pl31">31</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
All the wheel patterns are very ancient, and appear to
be simply conventional wheels. In France they were
called <i>ro&eacute;s</i>. There is a fine instance of this wheel pattern
in Auberville&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tissus.&rdquo; The wheels sometime enclose
triumphal cars and other pictorial subjects. (Pl. <a href="#pl34">34</a>.)</p>

<p>The patterns which are apparently composed with the
intention of avoiding all meaning, are the Moorish.
They are neither animal, vegetable, nor anything else.
They show no motive in their complicated domes, their
honeycombing, and their ingenious conventional forms;
but cover equally textile fabrics or stucco ceilings without
suggesting any idea, religious or symbolical.</p>

<p>All the splendid Italian brocades and velvet damasks
were of conventional patterns, and like their Arab and
Sicilian models, and also like their Spanish contemporaries,
represented, and sought to represent nothing
on earth. It was all floreated and meandering design;
the motive reminding one of the pine-apple and the
acanthus, or of vine stems meeting or parting, but never
anything naturalistic for a moment. When animals were
introduced it was always as a pattern doubled face to
face, as if folded down a straight line.</p>

<p>We may say the same of the succeeding Louis
Quatorze and the Louis Quinze styles, which were of
the culminating period of clever and fantastic conventional
decoration.</p>

<p>Our modern designs have phases of imitation, and the
patterns of rich brocades which our great-grandmothers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
wore, came into fashion again about the third decade of
this century. Now we have been trying to find our inspirations
further back, and some of our copies of the
simpler Sicilian patterns, with an occasional pair of birds,
or a conventional plant, imitating the motive of the tree
of life, have been very pretty. The only defect is the
poverty which results from the absence of any active
and informing motive. It is,
however, easier to criticize than
to create.</p>

fault with a very common method
of converting a natural object into
a conventional pattern, by radiation.
Certain modes of repetition
are very objectionable. A
pattern, for instance, repeated
four times round a centre, or a
natural flower repeated exactly,
but lying north, south, east, and
west, are more or less inartistic,
we may say vulgar. (Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>.)</p>

Radiated Sunflower.</span>
</div>

<p>A natural flower may be conventionalized
and radiated by
placing it in the centre of the
composition facing you; and the
leaves arranged surrounding it,
so as to formalize the design,
though there is nothing really
unnatural in the way in which
they are made to grow. The illustration of a radiated
sunflower explains my meaning.</p>

<p>It has been already observed that by repetition almost
any object may be reduced to a pattern, but taste must
be exercised in the selection of what is appropriate and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
beautiful. Radiation is also really a useful factor in
conventional art, but common sense must guide the
artist here as well as taste. In radiating the forms of a
flower, nature gives endless hints of beauty; but a radiating
pattern of human figures would be ridiculous, and
even the branches of a tree cannot be so treated.</p>

<p>The awning of the classic hyp&aelig;thral hall or court
was often reproduced in Roman arabesques. Sometimes
we find it in a classical tomb, painted over
the ceiling, and recalling its original use. This was
revived in the Cinque-cento Renaissance; and again in
Adams&rsquo; &ldquo;Eighteenth Century Decorations,&rdquo; it became an
accepted pattern, called &ldquo;the shell,&rdquo; losing its original
motive, and descending to fill up the panels of tea-caddies
and surround keyholes. When thus reduced
to the appearance of a little ruff, it needs
some thought to recognize it, and give it
credit for its first motive.</p>

<p>It is amusing to find how a form which it seems
impossible to reduce to a pattern, will yet fall into one
by a judicious arrangement of light and shadow, and by
repetition. There is a little frieze in one of the Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
cases on the staircase in the British Museum, which is
extremely pretty and effective. It consists of a repetition
of little balconies with recesses and pillars and figures
in pairs. I give it as illustrating the way conventional
patterns grow. This balcony pattern is of the sixth
century, <small>A.D.</small></p>

<p>The ancient palmated pattern called Chrysoclavus,
from the beginning of our era to the thirteenth century
was partly a nail-headed design, and had become a
Christian symbol. It was, probably, originally the primitive
spot pattern; afterwards promoted to being an
ornament of discs in colour or metal: this was Assyrian,
Etruscan, and Mycen&aelig;an.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> (Pl. <a href="#pl70">70</a>.)</p>

<p>Among the conventional patterns which have apparently
no hidden meaning, but which clearly show
their descent, are the Chinese and Japanese wicker
and lattice-work designs. The beauty of these is
wonderful.</p>

<p>Semper shows that wicker (including bamboo work)
was the foundation of all Chinese civilized life, for constructing
houses, bridges, utensils, and for decoration.
He gives this wicker-work origin to the universal key
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
pattern, which may, however, have a double source&mdash;the
wave, and the wicker-work.</p>

<p>We find the Key pattern in a tomb at Essiout, in
Egypt, painted perhaps about 1600 <small>B.C.</small>, in company
with some other very old friends,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> the Tuscan border,
the Egg and Tongue, and the Bead, the Daisy, and the
Wave. (Pl. <a href="#pl17">17</a>, No. 2.) We meet it everywhere in ancient
and modern decoration. There are several forms of it
on a large terra-cotta vase in the British Museum from
Kameiros in Rhodes, and on Chinese fictiles and embroideries.
It is found also on garments in Iceland,
whither the Greek patterns must have drifted through
Norway, and, as they could go no further, there they
remained.</p>

<p>I have often spoken of the extraordinary survival
of a pattern. This is easy to account for when fashion,
&ldquo;the disturber,&rdquo; had not yet existed. Then the ancient
motive told its own tale, and its great age was its
claim to perpetual youth; but it is more remarkable
where we meet with revivals at distant periods, and
apparently without any connecting link of ancestry or
style.</p>

<p>For instance, the women of Genoa wore large cotton
veils, printed with the Indian conventional tree and
beast pattern, down to thirty years ago, when the fashion
changed, and winter bonnets and summer muslin veils
displaced the old costume. These patterns are now being
printed in England on scores of cotton curtains for beds
and windows.</p>

<h4>GEOMETRICAL.</h4>

<p>Geometrical patterns may be reduced to a very few
primitive elements.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 403px;">
<a name="fig18" id="fig18"></a>
<img src="images/naaf18.png" width="403" height="600"
alt="Different patterns formed from circles and squares" />
</div>

<p class="caption">Fig. 18.<br />
Varied adjustments of Square and
Circle.</p>

<p>1. The Line, including straight and wavy lines.</p>

<p>2. The Angular Forms, including squares, oblongs,
cubes, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
3. The Triangular, including zigzags, diamonds, &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. The Circular, including all spots, discs, and radiations.</p>

<p>All these can be blended or mixed so as to form endless
varieties. For instance, the square and the circle can
intersect each other in different proportions, so as to give
an entirely new effect to the pattern, each time the
balance is altered or the phase of the repetition varied.
The illustration will explain this. (Fig. <a href="#fig18">18</a>.)</p>

<p>Right angles may intersect each other so as to produce
the whole gamut of Chinese lattice-work decoration, and
all the Celtic and Scandinavian entwined patterns, from
which so many of the embroideries in the Italian pictures
of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries are probably
descended.</p>

<p>The Moorish patterns are geometrical, and are created
on the principle of avoiding in art the representation
of any created thing. They show much ingenuity in
keeping clear of any possible meaning. Most of these
conventional patterns are founded on the ogee-arch and
a kind of honeycomb pattern, involved and inverted.
Their tiles, which nearest approach textile design, have,
indeed, certain vegetable forms added to the others,
but always geometrically arranged as no vegetables ever
grew.</p>

<p>Geometrical patterns begin with primitive forms, and
come down to the floor-cloth designs of to-day. They
can be extracted in endless variety from the combinations
of the kaleidoscope. This style is well suited for pavements
in mosaic&mdash;either secular or ecclesiastical.</p>

<p>The Opus Alexandrinum furnishes us with most
beautiful examples and adaptations for large or small
spaces, so as to form the richest or the simplest floor
decorations. How worthily a church may be thus
adorned may be seen on the vast area of the floor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, or that of the Church
of St. Mark in Venice.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to the Opus Alexandrinum
in textiles has been in Patchwork, of which a more
artistic use may yet be made. We might exercise
ingenuity in this direction, giving really fine and effective
designs to our workers in patches, whose productions are,
in general, simply alarming.</p>

<p>The fine quilting patterns of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries are almost always geometrical, and make
the best background to more resplendent embroideries
overlying them, which is partly owing to their being
only forms, and conveying no idea or inherited meaning.
These expressionless designs are well fitted for spaces
and borders in which the centres are elaborated, and
require enclosing or framing; likewise, they are suited
for large areas, which must not be perfectly plain, and
yet not too disturbing to the eye, so as to distract it
from the more important ornaments on the wall or ceiling.
They suit carpets in passages or on staircases much
better than any other kind of design, and form the best
figured backgrounds for pictures. Both eye and mind
often need repose, and therefore the simpler the geometrical
pattern is, the better. Complicated and too
ingenious combinations are painfully fatiguing. Simplicity
and flatness are the greatest merits in such forms,
as in shadowless patterns for textiles, and especially
for embroideries.</p>

<p>If we turn to nature to assist us with new geometrical
patterns, we shall find the most exquisite forms in the
crystals of every newly-fallen snowflake, and in the
nodal-points on a plate of metal or glass, covered with
sand, and struck by sound. We shall hardly ever find
in these a repetition of exactly the same combination,
and their variety is only equalled by their beauty.</p>

round baskets of fresh blossoms. See Wilkinson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Manners and

&ldquo;(Euripides <i>loquitur</i>) Not horse-cocks, nor yet goat-stags, such as

The Persian carpets, which are the legitimate descendants of Babylonian
art, are curiously fragmentary. In a modern design are to be seen birds,
indicated by a head, bill, and eyes; little coffee-pots, and flowers broken
off at the stalks, and small quadrupeds without any particular form;
also the prehistoric cross, the Tau, and bits of broken-up wave and key
patterns. All these, repeated into a pattern, remind us of scraps in a
kaleidoscope, thrown together accidentally, or else taken up by chance

growing in Paradise.&rdquo; It is always represented as something like a

Sir George Birdwood says: &ldquo;The intimate absorption of Hindu
life in the unseen realities of man&rsquo;s spiritual consciousness is seldom
sufficiently acknowledged by Europeans, and, indeed, cannot be fully
comprehended by men whose belief in the supernatural has been
destroyed by the prevailing material ideas of modern society. Every
thought, wish, and deed of the Hindu belongs to the world of the
unseen as well as the seen; and nothing shows this more strikingly
than the traditionary works of India. Everything that is made has a
direct religious use, or some religious symbolism. The materials of
which different articles are fashioned, their weight, and the colours with
which they are painted, are fixed by religious rule. An obscured
symbolism of material and colour is to be traced also in the forms
of things, even for the most domestic uses. Every detail of Indian
decoration, Aryan or Turanian, has a religious meaning, and the arts
of India will never be rightly understood until there are brought to
their study, a familiar acquaintance with the character and subjects of
the religious poetry, national legends, and mythological scriptures that
have always been their inspiration, and of which they are the perfected
imagery.&rdquo; See Sir George Birdwood&rsquo;s &ldquo;Indian Arts,&rdquo; part i. p. 2.</p>

Authorities differ in describing the Chrysoclavus. Sir G. Birdwood
calls it a button pattern (&ldquo;Indian Arts,&rdquo; vol. ii. p. 241). The &ldquo;Chrysoclavus&rdquo;
was the name given to the palmated or triumphal pattern with
which the consular robes are invariably embroidered in the Roman
Consular ivories at Zurich, Halberstadt, and in the South Kensington
Museum. The tenacious life of this pattern is curiously shown in the
way it appears in the fifteenth century on Italian playing-cards. (See
&ldquo;Cartes &agrave; Jouer,&rdquo; an anonymous French book in the print-room of the
British Museum.) The kings and knaves wear the Byzantine humeral,
and the Chrysoclavus pattern is carved on their chairs. Till lately
English playing-cards showed the same dress-pattern. I shall discuss
the Latin Clavus and the Chrysoclavus amongst ecclesiastical embroideries,
pp. 308, 336 (<i>post</i>).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>MATERIALS.</h3>


<h4>1. RAW MATERIALS.</h4>

<p>The history of an art must, more or less, include that of
its raw material.</p>

<p>This is too true to be disputed, but in the art of
embroidery it opens out such endless avenues, through
such vast regions of technical study, that we must acknowledge
the difficulty, or rather the impossibility, of including
in one volume even a tithe of the information
already collected.</p>

<p>I shall, therefore, only dedicate a few pages to the
history of those fibres which have always been most
important in the different phases of our civilization.</p>

<p>Among books on textile materials, I must again name
the &ldquo;Textrinum Antiquorum,&rdquo; by Yates. His premature
death, and the loss that the world of art and manufacture
has sustained by the chain of his invaluable researches
being broken, cannot be appreciated but through the
study of the first and only volume of this already rare
book, from which I venture to quote largely.</p>

<p>Semper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Der Stil&rdquo; is a work of reference on this
subject, so valuable that it should, by a good translation,
be placed within the reach of non-German scholars.</p>

<p>From Colonel Yule&rsquo;s &ldquo;Marco Polo,&rdquo; and his abundant
notes, we learn much of Asiatic textile art in the thirteenth
century, and its early traditions in the immutable East,
and Sir G. Birdwood&rsquo;s books on this Indian art are most
instructive.</p>

<p>Egyptian textiles are splendidly illustrated by Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
Gardiner Wilkinson. All these modern writers quote
Pliny and the Periplus;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and Pliny quotes all the
classic authors, from Homer to his day. Here is a wide
field for gathering information regarding the materials
for embroidery in past ages.</p>

<p>When we use the phrase &ldquo;raw material&rdquo; so glibly,
with an &aelig;sthetic contempt for that which the art of man
has neither manipulated nor reorganized, we show our
own coarse appreciation, if not ignorance, of the wonderful
inherent beauty and microscopic delicacy of form, colour,
and substance of those materials which we fashion for
our own uses.</p>

<p>Few know the structure of the tender filaments of
wool, flax, cotton, and silk; or that each has its peculiar
form and attributes, and its individual capabilities for the
purposes for which they appear to us to have been
created, i.e. the clothing and adornment of man&rsquo;s dress
and his home.</p>

<p>I should like to draw attention to these well-attested
facts.</p>

<p>Seen through a microscope, the forms of these raw
materials differ greatly.</p>

<p>Flax is difficult to describe, as it varies according to
the soil and climate it comes from. Its fibre, however,
has always a shiny outer surface, and is transparent,
cylindrical, and pipe-like; apparently with breaks or
joints like those of a cane.</p>

<p>Cotton also varies so much in its own kind, that every
description is different and somewhat puzzling. Semper
says that it approaches the ribbon form, with thickened
edges, and is like a half-cylinder twisted spirally; but
when wetted with oil, it swells into a complete cylinder.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
Wool and hair are hollow pipes without joints. Woollen
fibres look like cylindrical snakes with a scaly surface.
This roughness gives wool a clinging power which exceeds
that of any other material, except the hair of some few
animals.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Silk threads consist of twin pipes laid parallel, and held
together by the varnish with which they are glazed.
Silk is tough and elastic.</p>

<p>The qualities needed for textile materials may be thus
enumerated: Pliability, toughness (i.e. tensile strength),
and intrinsic durability.</p>

<p>Of course, the material must to a certain degree influence
the style of the fabric, and its selection must be
according to the effect intended to be produced.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The
fashions of the day, and the needs of the special manufacture,
must greatly modify the choice of materials,
which fluctuate, often disappear, and sometimes revive
again.</p>

<p>Certain materials which have been, at one period, much
admired, have been entirely lost; and indeed we may
say that the only permanently employed textiles are
wool, flax, cotton, and silk, which apparently never can
be superseded. With them, all domestic requirements
can be satisfied, and all artistic and decorative fabrics
produced, varied, and perfected; and these, from all time
recorded in history, have been enriched and glorified
with gold, either inwoven or embroidered.</p>

<p>The game of &ldquo;animal, vegetable, or mineral&rdquo; might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
well be played with textiles only. Nothing has been alien
to the crafts which from time immemorial have spun,
woven, felted, netted, and embroidered.</p>

<p>The materials now in general use, and which, once
known, have never been abandoned, I have already
named, and shall discuss their history separately; they
are wool, flax, cotton, and silk. To these I must add
hemp, both wild and cultivated.</p>

<p>Hemp is a kind of nettle. It was grown in Colchis, and
in those cool regions which did not produce flax. Hemp
is hardly grown in India, except to extract from it the
narcotic, Cannabis Indica. It was a northern production
used throughout Scandinavia. Herodotus (iv. 14) says,
&ldquo;Hemp grows in the land of the Scythians, in a wild state,
but it is now cultivated.&rdquo; From its Latin name, <i>cannabis</i>,
comes our canvas, which has always been much used as a
ground for counted stitches and backing for embroidery,
its stiffness being its qualification for such purposes.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Jute (a rough sort of hemp) has been long an article of
commercial importance for the manufacture of coarse-figured
fabrics, dyed and woven, sometimes embroidered.</p>

<p>The fibre of the Aloe has been used in the Riviera for
laces and &ldquo;macrami&rdquo; (knotted fringes).</p>

<p>The fibres of grasses, such as the &ldquo;Honduras silk
grass&rdquo; (Rhea or Ramie), valuable for beauty, fineness,
and toughness, have been worked or woven into stuffs.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
This material is now coming into notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
Spartum is often named for coarse weaving;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> also the
fibres of barks, especially those of palm branches.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Another substance of classic use, and even now employed,
though rather as a curiosity than as an article of
commerce, is the silky filament produced by the shell-fish
pinna; and also the fibres of certain sea-weeds.</p>

<p>Fur and hair, especially that of camels and goats, has
always been much prized.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> We have seen both African
and Indian striped or primitively decorated rugs of wool,
touched here and there with scraps of cotton or silk, or
some other odd material; and amongst them, tufts of
human hair. The sentiment that motived the use of
human hair has been either love or hate&mdash;the votive
or the triumphal. We know that Delilah was not a
stranger to this art. She wove into her web Samson&rsquo;s
seven locks of strength, and &ldquo;fastened them with a pin&rdquo;
(Judges xvi.).</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century it was the custom for ladies
to weave their own hair into their gifts to favoured
knights. King Ris, if he had received any such token
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
from his lady-love, returned it with interest; for he sent
her a mantle in which were inwoven the beards of nine
conquered kings, a tenth space being left for that of King
Arthur, which he promised to add in course of time.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Leather has been from the remotest antiquity employed
for the art of embroidery, either for the ground, as in
the mantle of Boadicea, made of skins with the fur turned
inwards and the leather outside, dressed, and embroidered
on the seams;<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> or else as fine inlaid and onlaid application,
as in the &ldquo;funeral tent of an Egyptian queen&rdquo; in the
museum at Boulac, which is certainly the earliest specimen
of needlework decoration that exists.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> (Pl. <a href="#pl44">44</a>.) The old
Indian embroideries in leather are generally applied one
on another. The North American Indians also embroider
on leather.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Feather work will be discussed under the heading of
&ldquo;Opus Plumarium.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>On the surface of textiles many substances have been
fastened down, in order to give brilliancy to the general
effect&mdash;skins of insects, beetles&rsquo; wings, the claws and
teeth of various animals.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Asbestos linen is the only mineral substance, besides
gold, silver, and tin,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> that has been employed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
embroidery. It has the remarkable quality of indestructibility
by fire. Asbestos linen can be cleansed by fire
instead of water.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> It is a soapy crystal, found in veins
of serpentine and cipolino in Cyprus, and other Greek
islands. Pliny says it was woven for the funeral obsequies
of monarchs, as it preserved the ashes apart, being itself
unharmed by the fires of cremation. There are several
fragments existing, found in tombs. One of these is in
the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Marco Polo speaks of a stone fibre found at Chinchin,
which answers in description to asbestos. It was spun
by mixing it with threads of flax soaked in oil; and when
woven, was passed through the fire to remove the flax
and the oil.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>A miraculous napkin of asbestos was long kept at
Monte Casino.</p>

<p>Coral, pearls, and beads of many forms have been
used for the enrichment of embroideries, and for decorating
textiles. The whole surface of the original fabric
has often been entirely covered with them, or the pattern
itself has been worked in nothing else. Pearls are
constantly seen worked on dress, coats-of-arms, and
embroidered portraits. Seed pearls, large coarse pearls,
and sometimes fine and precious ones, were surrounded
with gold thread embroidery. Coral was so much used
in Sicilian embroideries, and so little elsewhere, that
one gives the name of &ldquo;Sicilian&rdquo; to all such work;
but occasionally we find coral embroideries in Spain
and elsewhere (Pl. <a href="#pl32">32</a>).</p>

Beads of glass were common in Egypt from the
earliest times, strung together by threads so as to form
breastplates rather than necklaces. Whence beads
originally came we cannot tell, but it seems that the
Ph&oelig;nicians dropped them on all the shores of the
world. Then, as now, savages had a passion for beads,
and civilized men and women still admire them as
trimmings. In the Middle Ages they were sometimes
worked into pictures.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>In as far as materials are essential to the art of embroidery,
I must restrict myself to the history of silk,
wool, flax, cotton, and gold. With these all the finest
works have been executed for the artistic adornment of
dress and hangings. All other materials have been
occasional experiments, or else were resorted to in the
absence or ignorance of the above five most important
factors in our domestic civilization. The history of
wool must take precedence as being that of the original,
if not the first, of textile materials.</p>


<h4>2. WOOL.</h4>

<p>The wool of sheep and the hair of goats were used
very early in the world&rsquo;s history for clothing, and
probably also for hangings. The earliest civilizations
plaited, span,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> wove, and felted them.</p>

<p>There is no reason to suppose that goats and sheep
preceded the creation of man. No early fossils record
them. Our sheep are supposed by zoologists to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
descended from the Argali or Ovis Ammon of Linn&aelig;us,
inhabiting the central regions of Asia.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>It is possible that plaited grasses may have preceded
wool. But though certain prehistoric specimens are
supposed to have been found in Spain, yet of this there
is but imperfect proof.</p>

<p>The pastoral tribes wandering over those fair regions
that extend from Khotan to Arabia, following their flocks
and herds, and studying where best to feed, increase,
and multiply them, and obtain from them the finest
texture of wool, are spoken of nowhere more than in the
collected books of the Old Testament, open to us all;
and there we learn how important a place these shepherds
held in the world&rsquo;s civilization. &ldquo;Watching their flocks
by night,&rdquo; they watched the stars also, and they were
astronomers; seeking the best pastures and fodder, they
learned to be botanists, florists, and agriculturalists. They
became also philosophers, poets, prophets, and kings.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
Job and his country were enriched through the breeding
of sheep. The seven daughters of Jethro, the High-priest,
tended their father&rsquo;s flocks.</p>

<p>The Arabians were always great breeders of sheep.
The Greeks and Romans, from Homer to Virgil, sang
of the herdsman&rsquo;s life. Our Lord Himself did not
disdain to be called &ldquo;the Good Shepherd.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The merchants who traded from the Arabian Gulf to
Egypt, and across thence to the shores of the Mediterranean,
and the Ph&oelig;nicians of Sidon who brought overland
their bales of raw material and manufactured Oriental
fabrics, knew well where to find the best goods for their
customers; and we hear frequently whence came this or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
that coloured wool. Chemmis, the city of Pan, retained
its celebrity in the woollen trade down to the conquest
of Egypt by the Romans. Nineveh and Babylon encouraged
the manufactures and commerce in woollen
tents, wall-hangings, and carpets. Nowhere were they
so richly embroidered.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Solomon purchased woollens from Egypt. Damascus
supplied the Tyrians with wool for their rugs. The stuffs
and textile fabrics of wool, of the Chinese, Assyrians, and
Chaldeans, are recorded in the earliest writings of the
human race. How much their decoration depended on
weaving, and how much on embroidery, we cannot tell.
The products of the Babylonian looms are alluded to in
the Book of Joshua,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and also by Ezekiel.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Assyrian stuffs were always celebrated for their splendid
colours and various designs; among which were hunting
scenes, battles, and special emblematic adornments.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>From Miletus came the wool valued most highly by
the Greeks. Spain produced the best black, and the
north of Italy the best white wool. The Narbonensian
and Egyptian wools were supposed to be the most
durable, and when they became shabby, were dipped
again and served another generation.</p>

<p>From Yates&rsquo; account of the great variety of wools,
remarkable for their fine texture, their whiteness,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
blackness,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> or their redness, their cool or their warm
tints, it is evident that the ancients valued highly these
different qualities.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The cloths that were of greatest
account were of the finest or the warmest kinds. The
sheep of Miletus, Attica, Megaris, and Tarentum were
clothed in jackets, in order to preserve the fineness and
whiteness of their own coats, and to protect them from
being torn by the thorny bushes in their pastures.
Columella calls them the &ldquo;covered&rdquo; and the &ldquo;soft,&rdquo; and
says they were often kept in the house.</p>

<p>We find notices of the peculiarities of the various
national breeds, caused by the soil on which their pasture
grew, and the rivers and streams at which they drank,
and these peculiarities were, if possible, encouraged.
There is evidence also that some improvement of the
breeds by crossing was practised in early times.</p>

<p>As in all the life of the Greeks, the religious element
had much influence in perfecting their flocks of sheep&mdash;only
the most beautiful animals were considered worthy
of sacrifice to the gods.</p>

<p>A few of the rare specimens of stuffs which have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
rescued from tombs, especially in the Crimea, and in the
Fayoum, in Egypt, show a wool so fine and shining that
it might be taken for silk, and the beauty of the weaving
is marvellous, and much varied in style.</p>

<p>A warrior&rsquo;s tomb in the district of Kuban contained a
funeral pall, covering the sarcophagus, measuring at least
three metres and a half each way, woven of brown
wool, in twelve narrow strips sewn together and afterwards
painted. The ground is yellowish, the design
brown. The figures repeat mythical subjects, and alternate
with patterns, and there is a border. One strip
contains a scene from the story of Peleus and Thetis.
Apparently this is Attic design. The coloured dresses
worn by women of rank, and hung on the statues of the
gods, were sometimes painted, sometimes stamped, and
often embroidered, and they were nearly all of woollen
fabrics.</p>

<p>One of the great advantages of wool is its power of
absorbing colour, as the pigment sinks into its very fibre,
instead of clinging to the surface. It can be dyed of
deeper colours than flax, cotton, or silk.</p>

<p>Pliny tells us that Tanaquil combed, span, and wove
her wool, and she herself made the royal mantle which
Servius Tullius used to wear, and it was covered with a
wavy pattern (undulata). Thence came the custom that
when a maiden became a bride, her attendants carried
a distaff trimmed with combed wool, and a spindle with
yarn upon it. The robes worked by Tanaquil were
dedicated by Servius Tullius to the statue of Fortune in
her temple at Rome, and were still hanging there in the
days of Tiberius.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Pliny remarks that it was a wonder
that it neither fell from the image, nor was eaten by the
moths, during five hundred and sixty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
He gives us interesting details of the weaving of
woollen cloths, and speaks of the thick coarse wool with
&ldquo;great thick hair,&rdquo; used for carpets from the time of
Homer. The same passage mentions felt. He tells us
of the cloths with a curly nap, used in the days of
Augustus; of the &ldquo;papaverata&rdquo; woven with flowers
resembling poppies; and we hear from him of the cloth
of divers colours woven in Babylon, and called thence
Babylonica; and the Alexandrian webs, with many-coloured
threads (polymita)<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>, comparing them with those
made in Gaul; and those woven by the Parthians.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>We have already said that the wool of Miletus was a
proverbial favourite with the Greeks. Eustathius speaks
of the excellence of the Milesian carpets and hangings.
Virgil represents the virgins of Cyrene spinning Milesian
wool dyed of a deep sea-green.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>In the British Museum is a fragment of Egyptian
woollen or worsted embroidery on white linen, discoloured
by its use as mummy wrapping; but the stitches of
worsted remain a perfectly clear bright crimson and
indigo blue. This shows how wool absorbs the colour
and retains it. Even when the surface is faded, it can
be made to emit it again by chemical processes.</p>

<p>In tombs in the Crimea have been found variously
woven and adorned woollen fabrics. There are fragments
resembling in their texture a fine rep&mdash;a sort of corded
stuff; another material resembling a woollen cr&ecirc;pe, or
fine &ldquo;nun&rsquo;s gauze.&rdquo; This veiled a golden wreath.
Then there is a stuff like what is now called &ldquo;atlas&rdquo;&mdash;a
kind of woollen satin. Some woollens are woven
simply like linen; some are wide, some very narrow,
sewn together in strips, woven in meandering designs.

One, like a piece of Gobelin tapestry, has a border of ducks
with yellow wings and dark green heads and throats,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and
then another with a pattern of stags&rsquo; heads. This description
recalls the specimens on plate <a href="#pl16">16</a> and plate <a href="#pl39">39</a>.</p>

<p>From these tombs are collected stuffs of wool, woven
and embroidered in gold with combinations of many
colours; and, in fact, through this collection, now placed
in the Museum at St. Petersburg, we become aware that
300 <small>B.C.</small> the Greeks had learned all the secrets of the art
of weaving wool. They, however, lost it, and it is only
in India that its continuity was never broken. Indian
looms still weave, of the finest fleeces, such shawls of
Babylonian design as repeat the texture of the ancient
Greek garments. But were they Greek? or did those
beautiful woven fabrics come from Persia or India?<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The first we know of Scandinavian wool for dress, is a
fragment from a Celtic barrow in Yorkshire&mdash;a woollen
plaited shroud. This fabric was an advance upon the
original northern savage costume&mdash;a sheep-skin fashioned
and sewn with a fish-bone for a needle, sinews for thread,
and a thorn for a pin. But we must imagine that some
use was made, besides plaiting, of the spun wool, of which
the early northern women have left us evidence, in the
whorls of their spindles, from prehistoric times.</p>

<p>Wool has always appeared to be a natural material for
dress. It is warm in winter, light in summer, and is
always beautiful as it hangs in lovely soft draperies,
heavy enough to draw the fabric into graceful curved
lines, and yet capable of yielding to each movement in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
little rippling folds, covering, but not concealing the
forms to which they cling. Classical draperies are
explained by it. What the Italians call the &ldquo;eyes of
the folds,&rdquo; are particularly beautiful in woollens, and lend
themselves to sculpturesque art.</p>

<p>The other natural use of wool is for carpets. We
have the evidence of the imitations, in mosaic, of carpets
from the stone floors in Nineveh (now in the British
Museum), that the art of weaving large and small rugs,
and the principles of composition for such purposes was
at that date well understood. The carpet-weaving traditions
of Babylon appear to have been inherited by the
occupiers of the soil, as it is supposed that the Saracens
learned from Persia the art of weaving pile carpets, and
imported thence craftsmen into Spain. We can trace
Persian carpet patterns in Indian floor coverings. The
Greeks called them <i>tapetes</i>; and the Latins adopted the
name; and hence the Italian <i>tapeti</i>, French <i>tapis</i>, and our
word tapestry.</p>

<p>As artistic material, to which the world owes much
beauty and comfort, woollens have always played a
great part in the decorations of our houses, as of our
garments. Fabrics have been made of them of every
description, from the cheapest and commonest to the most
refined; but if woollen stuffs are to be beautiful, they
must be <em>fine</em>, and worked or embroidered by hand.</p>

<p>Woollens brocaded or figured are not so effective as
silken hangings. Woollen velvets are without light, dull
and heavy. Still, even amongst our English fabrics, there
have always been varieties of texture<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and adaptations
to different effects, and some are beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
Worsted thread, so called from Worsted, in Norfolk,
where the materials for weaving and embroidering are
manufactured, has always been very important in embroidery.
Worsteds after a time gave way to a very
beautiful material, called &ldquo;German wool,&rdquo; which again has
yielded the supremacy to &ldquo;crewels&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> (resembling the old
worsteds). These crewels are nearly the same in substance
and in their loose texture as the threads prepared
from wool for tapestry weaving.</p>

<p>We may claim, in England, the superiority in this
manufacture, though we are constantly receiving from
France novelties which give us good hints, and urge us to
keep pace with the science of the Gobelins in their woollen
dyes. The French, in return, employ our wools, especially
those of Lincolnshire, in their tapestry workshops.</p>

<p>The wool and hair of goats should be a study by
itself. They have from the earliest times been used in
India for the finest and softest fabrics, such as the lovely
shawls of Cashmere and the neighbouring provinces.
Cloth of Tars in the Middle Ages is supposed to be
what is now called Cashmere.</p>


<h4>3. FLAX.</h4>

<p>Boyd Dawkins tells us that &ldquo;The art of spinning and
the manufacture of linen were introduced into Europe in
the Neolithic age, and have been preserved with little
variation from that period to the present day, in certain
remote parts of Europe, having only been superseded in
modern times by the complicated machinery so familiar
to us. The spindle and distaff, or perforated spindle
whorls, are of stone, pottery, or bone, such as are constantly
found in Neolithic tombs and habitations. Thread from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
the Swiss lake cities is proved to be of flax, and there is
evidence of weaving in some sort of loom.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>The meaning of the word Byssus has been disputed;
some authorities asserting that it includes both flax and
cotton fabrics. Without the aid of the microscope, the
dispute as to whether the material of the Egyptian
mummy wrappings was cotton or flax, or a mixture of
the two, would never have been settled; but now that
the difference of the structure of each has been clearly
ascertained, we know that cotton was never employed
in Egypt, except for certain domestic uses. The mummy
wrappings are entirely linen. Cotton was forbidden for
the priests&rsquo; dress in the temple, though they might wear
it when not on duty.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>There are specimens of Egyptian painted or printed
patterns on fine linen in the British Museum;<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> and it is
curious to see in Egyptian mural paintings the same
patterned chintzes on furniture that were common a
hundred years ago in England. Both must have come
from India, and therefore were certainly cotton fabrics.</p>

<p>Herodotus says the mummy cloths were of &ldquo;byssine
sindon,&rdquo; which may be translated &ldquo;linen cloth.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Cotton
he calls &ldquo;tree wool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yates has carefully argued the whole question, and, we
think, has proved that byssus was flax, and not cotton.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
He quotes Philo, who certainly must have believed that
it was made of flax, from the description he gives of
its appearance and qualities, which in no way apply to
cotton or hemp. He says that &ldquo;The Jewish high priests
wore a linen garment of the purest byssus&mdash;which was a
symbol of firmness, incorruption, and of the clearest
splendour, for fine linen is very difficult to tear. It is
made of nothing mortal, and becomes brighter and more
resembling light, the more it is cleansed by washing.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Here is another quotation: &ldquo;Cloth of byssus symbolizes
firm faith. Its threads surpass even ropes of
broom in firmness and strength.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Pliny says the flax
grown in Egypt was superior to any other, and it was
exported to Arabia and India.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The first known existing
fragment of flax linen in Europe was taken from the tomb
of the Seven Brothers in the Crimea. Its date is 300 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>In Solomon&rsquo;s time the Jews evidently depended upon
Egypt for their fine linen. Herodotus describes the
corselet of Amasis, the fineness of the linen, and the
embroidered decorations of men and animals, partly gold
and partly tree wool (i.e. cotton).<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>All the finest linen certainly came then from Egypt,
and was much finer than any that is now made. That
we call cambric, was woven there many centuries before
it was made in Cambray.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Through the Ph&oelig;nicians the fine linen came to Rome,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
as appears from the following notice of embroidery on
linen by Flavius Vopiscus, in his &ldquo;Life of the Emperor
Carinus:&rdquo; &ldquo;Why should I mention the linen cloths
brought from Tyre and Sidon, which are so thin as to
be transparent, which glow with purple, or are prized on
account of their laborious embroideries?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The history of a fine embroidered linen curtain for a
Roman house might have been this:&mdash;Grown in Egypt;
carried to Nomenticum (Artois), and there woven; taken
to India to be embroidered, and thence as merchandise
to Rome.</p>

<p>While flax was making its way northward, the Celts
must also have taken it across Europe from their resting-place,
after emigrating from the East. The word <em>linen</em>&mdash;<i>lin-white</i>&mdash;is
a Celtic epithet, whereas <em>flax</em> is an
Anglo-Saxon word.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The Atrebates wove linen in Artois, 1800 years ago.
Jerome speaks of their &ldquo;indumenta,&rdquo; or shirts of fine linen;
and the great weavers of to-day are still the Flemish
descendants of the Atrebates. Their Celtic descent
is witnessed in the Irish by their superiority in the crafts
of the loom.</p>

<p>The fine laces of Venice, France, and Belgium are all
of linen, i.e. flaxen thread. Clearness and strength in
these delicate fabrics cannot be obtained with cotton,
which, especially when it is washed, swells and fluffs, and
never has the radiant appearance and purity of flax.</p>

<p>Embroidery is always a natural accompaniment of fine
linen. Those that are still preserved to us from early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
and Middle-Age times are nearly all on linen, if not on
silk. The woollen fragments are very few and imperfect.
They have been invariably &ldquo;fretted&rdquo; by the moth.</p>

<p>White needle embroidery is mostly worked in linen-thread,
though cotton-thread has been used a great deal,
and is very fit for the purpose.</p>


<h4>4. COTTON.</h4>

<p>Cotton was native to India,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> as flax was to Egypt.
It not only was grown, woven, and printed there from
the remotest antiquity, but was cultivated nowhere else.
The Egyptians do not appear to have grown it till the
fourteenth century <small>A.D.</small>, though they had long imported
it as raw material, and as plain and printed webs.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> It
was called tree-wool.</p>

<p>It was first woven in Italy in the thirteenth century,
and used for making paper; and in the sixteenth, the
plant was grown in the south of Europe. From Italy
it was carried into the Low Countries, and only reached
England in the seventeenth century,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> so lately has the
great staple of our manufactures first belonged to us.</p>

<p>The fibre of cotton has neither the strength nor the
durability of flax or silk, but it is the third in the group
of the most universally qualified materials for all purposes
of domestic textile art, ranging from carpets and
sails, to fine chintzes for dress, and filmy muslins. The
cloudy effect of these delicate fabrics is their own peculiar
beauty. Muslins for hangings, printed or embroidered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
have always been a luxury from India; they were called
&ldquo;carbasa,&rdquo; and were much esteemed in Rome as a protection
against the sun.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>But we have much earlier notice of them, as being the
curtains described in the Book of Esther, hung with
silver rings to the pillars of marble in the banqueting
hall at Susa or Shushan: &ldquo;blue and white muslin&rdquo; (i.e.
carpas,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> mistranslated &ldquo;green&rdquo; in the Authorized Version),
&ldquo;fastened with cords of fine linen and purple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;carbasina&rdquo; occurs in a play by Statius, evidently
translated from a writer of the new Greek comedy
period. It may be inferred, therefore, that the Greeks
used cotton 200 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> A century before, Nearchus (one
of Alexander&rsquo;s admirals) speaks of the cotton-trees in
India as if they were a new discovery. Yates gives us
many quotations from Latin classical authors, proving
the common use of cotton. Its Latin name was <i>bambacinum</i>,
from <i>bombax</i>, hence the Italian <i>bambagio</i>,
<i>bambagino</i>, <i>bambasino</i>.</p>

<p>The variety of cotton fabrics in India is very
numerous, each having its distinctive beauties and
qualities inherited by tradition from early times. They
are enumerated and described in Sir G. Birdwood&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Arts of India.&rdquo; Almost all of them have been
made to carry embroideries&mdash;the transparent muslins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
as well as the fine cloths, and the stronger and thicker
fabrics.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Most old English houses contain some hangings of
thickly woven cotton, probably Indian, worked in crewel
or worsted, of the time of James I., or a little earlier;
and beautiful patterns wrought in silk or thread, on fine
cotton linen, reminding one of the arabesques of the
Taj Mahal, succeeded those of the Jacobean style.</p>

<p>Transparent muslins were often embroidered in gold
and silver, or spangled and embossed with beetles&rsquo; wings;
and gold, silver, and silk were lavished on Indian cotton
grounds, as well as on silken stuffs. Linen was not much
embroidered in India, but often printed like chintz.</p>

<p>Buckram, or plush of cotton, was certainly imported
from the East to England, from the thirteenth century to
the time of Elizabeth. There is at Ashridge, in Hertfordshire,
a small jacket of very fine cotton-plush amongst
the baby linen prepared by Elizabeth for the expected
heir of Philip and Mary, and there are other small
dresses of this material of the date of James I. A similar
material called fustian is also named by Marco Polo as a
cotton fabric; it is supposed to have been made in Egypt
by the Arabs. This sort of cotton-plush, variously manipulated,
is repeatedly mentioned by Herr Graf&rsquo;schen in
his &ldquo;Catalogue of Egyptian Textiles from the Fayoum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plano Carpini says the tunics of the Tartars were
&ldquo;bacramo,&rdquo; or else of baudichin (cloth of gold). Falstaff&rsquo;s
&ldquo;men in buckram&rdquo; may be thus explained.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
I have already said that cotton is inferior in its
qualities to silk and flax, except in the production of
transparent muslins. Its peculiarity is its tendency to
&ldquo;crinkle&rdquo; or crumple in wearing, therefore it does not
present a smooth flat surface, except by means of dressing,
which unfits it for clinging effects but suits printed
patterns. Such stuffs as workhouse sheeting, imitating
certain fabrics of the sixteenth century, and which it has
been the fashion of late to cover with embroidery, do
not repay, by effective beauty, the trouble bestowed
upon them.</p>


<h4>5. GOLD.</h4>

<p>A somewhat profane French writer, giving his ideas
on the Creation, says that gold, the latest metal, was
expressly created for the demoralization of mankind. This
is an ugly version of the fact that it is found on the surface
of the earth&rsquo;s crust, and that its beauty and worth makes
it a desirable possession for which men will ever contend.</p>

<p>Gold adorns every work of the artistic animal&mdash;man.
It is the most becoming setting to all other beautiful
things, the most gorgeous reflection of light and colour,
the richest and softest background, the most harmonious
medium for high lights. In all works of decoration it
represents sunshine where it is not, and doubles it where
it is. The word &ldquo;illumination&rdquo; in books belongs to the
gilded illustrations of immortal thoughts.</p>

<p>In embroideries, as grounding or as pattern, gold gives
the glory: &ldquo;Her clothing is of wrought gold.&rdquo; The
raiment of needlework is comparatively ineffective without
golden lights or background. As colour, it never can
offend the eye, except when used to accentuate aggressively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
a vulgar pattern, or when it flashes and dazzles
from over-polish and too lavish expenditure.</p>

<p>Silver follows gold as a splendid element in decoration,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
but it is not of such universal application and use; and when
employed together, the proportion of gold should preponderate.
Golden tissues belong to the earliest civilizations.</p>

<p>Sir G. Birdwood says that &ldquo;The art of gold brocades
is older than the Code of Manu.... The excellence
of the art passed in the long course of ages, from one
place to another; and Babylon, Tarsus, Alexandria,
Baghdad, Damascus, Antioch, Tabriz, Sicily, and Tripoli
successively became celebrated for their gold and silver-wrought
tissues, silks, and brocades.... Through
every disguise (and mingling of style) it is not impossible
to infer the essential identity of the brocades with
the fabrics of blue, purple, and scarlet, worked in gold,
of ancient Babylonian art.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The Israelites wove gold with their coloured woollens
for the use of the sanctuary, and probably brought the art
from Egypt; though I am not aware of any gold-woven
stuffs from Egyptian tombs.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Indian and Chinese stuffs were from time immemorial
woven with gold.</p>

<p>The historians of Alexander the Great continually
name gold as a material in dress.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Arrian, Justin, and
Quintus Curtius, all speak of golden tissues as part of
the luxury of the East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
We hear of Darius&rsquo; dress woven with golden hawks;
and of the golden spoils of Persepolis; the dresses worn
by Alexander&rsquo;s generals, and all his attendants clothed
in purple and gold. Then, perhaps, the Babylonian tradition
was brought to Europe; and ever after, purple
and gold became the state apparel for courtiers as well
as kings.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The hangings of scarlet, purple, and gold used at the
nuptials of Alexander, and at his funeral, and his pall of
the same material, point to the fact that gold was a
recognized element in splendid textile weaving, as well
as in the earliest ornamental embroideries.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Attalus II., king of Pergamus, was credited with being
the inventor of gold weaving, but this must have been a
mistake, as it was practised long before his time; but he
may have devised some splendid golden tissues, which
were called &ldquo;Attalic,&rdquo; in honour of the king&rsquo;s patronage.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
As, however, the gold flat plate or wire was probably
that woven before his time,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> it is possible that he may
have invented or patronized the making of thread of
gold, by twining it round flax or cotton.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
Pliny says gold may be woven or spun like wool
without any admixture of wool or flax,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and he quotes as
examples the golden garment of Agrippina, and that worn
by Tarquinius Priscus, mentioned by Verrius.</p>

<p>It appears that the Egyptians knew the art of drawing
gold wire, as some pieces have been found in their jewellery;<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
but we know not by what process it was worked,
either then, or in the dark ages.</p>

<p>A mechanic of Nuremberg, in the fourteenth century,
invented a machine for the purpose; and this art of
drawing wire was introduced into England 200 years
later, in 1560.</p>

<p>The pure cut gold was in use in Rome to a late date.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
St. Cecilia, martyred 230 <small>A.D.</small>, was buried with her golden
mantle lying at her feet; and in 821, when Pope Pascal
opened her grave, he found the evidence of her martyrdom
in that splendid garment, showing that it had been soaked
in blood.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>There were found under the foundations of the new

In the writings of the Middle Ages we find constant
reference to different golden fabrics. Among them are
&ldquo;samit&rdquo; or &ldquo;examitur&rdquo; (a six-thread silk stuff, preciously
inwoven with gold threads);<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and &ldquo;ciclatoun,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> which
was remarkable for the lightness of its texture, and was
woven with shining gold threads&mdash;but though light, it
was stiff enough to carry heavy embroidery. We hear
also of &ldquo;baudekin,&rdquo; &ldquo;nak,&rdquo; and cloth of pall. &ldquo;Camoca&rdquo;
is &ldquo;kincob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There appears to be a link between embroidery in
gold and the jewellers&rsquo; work which in the Dark and
Middle Ages was so often applied to ecclesiastical and
royal dress and hangings. This link was beaten gold
work, &ldquo;aurobacutos,&rdquo; &ldquo;beaten work,&rdquo; or &ldquo;batony.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick in the time of Henry
VI., went over to France, having a &ldquo;coat for my lord&rsquo;s
body, beat with fine gold (probably heraldic designs).
For his ship, a streamer forty yards long and eight broad,
with a great bear and griffin, and 400 &lsquo;pencils&rsquo; with the
&lsquo;ragged staff&rsquo; in silver.&rdquo; This mode lasted some time;
for in 1538, Barbara Mason bequeathed to a church a
&ldquo;vestment of green silk beaten with gold.&rdquo; Probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
this beaten gold was really very thick gold-leaf laid on
the silk or linen ground, as we see still in some Sicilian
and Arab tissues. The embroidered banners taken from
Charles le T&eacute;m&eacute;raire, at Grandson, are finished with
broad borders of gilded inscriptions, such as might be
called beaten gold work.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>But besides this thick gold-leaf, there was another
mode of enriching embroideries. Lamin&aelig; of gold were
cut into shapes, and finished the work by accentuating
the design in Eastern embroideries; They are found
also in Greek tombs, and in the Middle Ages they
varied from the little golden spangle to many other
forms&mdash;circular rings, stars, crescents, moons, leaves,
and solid pendant wedges of gold, all which approached
the art of the goldsmith.</p>

India sent to Europe more art in gold thread than has

<p>The people of Goa, mostly Arabs, embroidered for
the Portuguese those wonderful fabrics, glittering with
gold and radiant with colours, which cover the beds and
hang the rooms throughout Portugal and Spain.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The
precious metals (often forming the whole grounding)
were employed without stint; the patterns being either
embroidered in coloured silks and gold; or on velvets
or satins, with gold alone or mixed with silver.</p>

<p>The fine gold threads for embroidery, which have
preserved their brilliancy for so many centuries, such as
we find worked in Charlemagne&rsquo;s dalmatic, in Aelfled&rsquo;s
maniple, and in the mitres of Thomas &agrave; Becket, are
certainly Oriental. To England they came in the bales
of the merchants who brought us our silk, and even our
needles, from India. Later we imported and copied the
different ways of giving effect to inferior metals, and the
Spaniard&rsquo;s gilt parchment thread reached us from their
Moorish manufactories.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>Designs were sometimes, in the sixteenth century,
worked in gold twisted with coloured silks, sometimes
only stitched down with them. The badges of the Order
of the Dragon, instituted by the Emperor Sigismund,
were thus embroidered, and placed on the cloaks of the
knights. The work was so perfect that it resembled
jewels of enamelled gold. Two ancient ones are in the
Museum at Munich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
Gold or silver or base metal wire was, in the later
Middle Ages and down to our own times, much employed
in the form of what is called &ldquo;purl,&rdquo; i.e. coiled wire cut
into short lengths, threaded on silk, and sewn down.
German, Italian, and English embroideries were often
enriched with this fabric. Sometimes the wire was
twisted with coloured silks before it was coiled. There
are beautiful specimens of this work of the days of
Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Still, throughout Europe the best works were carried
out with the best materials, and these always came from
the East. But we sometimes find that the pressure of
circumstances has for a time caused the employment of
adulterated metals that have perished; and thus many
fine works of art have been spoiled.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>The use of bad materials has therefore been as unfortunate
for art as that of pure gold, which has tempted so
many ignorant persons to burn golden embroideries and
tapestries, and melt down the ore they contain. How
little of all that human skill and invention have carefully
elaborated is now preserved to us! To gold and silver
textiles their materials have been often a fatal dower.</p>

<p>It has sometimes puzzled any but the most experienced
embroiderers to distinguish between the stuffs woven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
with the golden threads on the surface, and finely
brocaded or patterned in the loom; and those other
cloths, embroidered by hand, which have been so
manipulated that hardly an atom of the gold can be
detected at the back. This is done by a technical
mode of treating the surface, which is more easily
shown than described. The gold is really drawn into
the spaces between the threads of the canvas or linen
grounding, but never pulled through. For many reasons
this is an advantage, and when executed cunningly, as
it was in England in the twelfth century, it is rich,
beautiful, lasting, and economical. It is a peculiar mark
of the &ldquo;opus Anglicanum,&rdquo; and it is to be seen in the
mitre at Munich, where this stitch is employed on a
white satin ground;<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> also in the working of the two
pluvials at San Giovanni Laterano at Rome, and at the
Museum at Bologna, as well as that at Madrid, which
are all three English of the thirteenth century, by design
as well as by stitches.</p>

<p>I cannot close this chapter without naming the many
schools of gold embroidery in Belgium, France, Germany,
Italy, and Spain. The King of Bavaria has an establishment
for gold work, and this is very finely carried out,
highly raised, and richly designed.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> In Spain there is
also a Royal School, where stately works are executed.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the modern designs are motiveless,
and not so beautiful as the old ones, and it is very
difficult to have any ancient piece of work copied exactly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
Little modernisms creep in wherever the pattern has
to be fitted into a new shape; for the accomplished
needlewoman is seldom an artist.</p>

<p>All honour is due to certain manufacturers at Lyons
who are working in the spirit of the old masters, and have
been seriously considering how best to reproduce the
beautiful soft surface of the gold thread of which the
secret was lost in the fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>The old Chinese flat gold was, about the sixteenth
century, superseded by what was manufactured in Spain,
and is no longer imported or, perhaps, even made.</p>


<h4>6. SILK.</h4>

<p>The origin and history of silk is learnedly and elaborately
discussed in Yates&rsquo; &ldquo;Textrinum Antiquorum.&rdquo;
He gives us his authorities, and literal translations for
the benefit of the unlearned, who cannot read the original
texts. I have availed myself without hesitation of his
quotations, and of the carefully considered opinions he
has drawn from them.</p>

<p>It has been already said that wool and flax preceded silk
in Egyptian, Greek, and Roman manufactures. There is
no certain mention of silk in the Books of the Old Testament.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
Silk is, however, named in the Code of Manu.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
No shred of silk has been found in any Egyptian
tomb, nor till lately, and with one exception only, in
those of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Auberville says, &ldquo;La soie ne fit son apparition en
Europe que 300 ans avant notre &egrave;re.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Pamphile, daughter of Plates, of Cos, is said by
Aristotle to have there first woven silk (300 <small>B.C.</small>).
Probably raw silk was brought to Cos from the interior
of Asia, and Pamphile is by some supposed to have
&ldquo;effil&egrave;d&rdquo; the solid manufactured silks, and woven them
again into gauzy webs. Yates suggests that it is possible
that Pamphile obtained cocoons and unwound
them, as the passage in Aristotle may be so interpreted.</p>

<p>The specimen of early silk-weaving which we have
above alluded to, was taken out of the &ldquo;Tomb of the
Seven Brothers&rdquo; at Kertch, in the Crimea, and is of the
third century <small>B.C.</small> It consists of several bits of very
transparent painted silk. These fragments are an actual
and yet a contemporary witness to the truth of the tradition
of Pamphile&rsquo;s Coan webs, which are of the same
date: possibly they were her handiwork.</p>

Roman. (Auberville, pl. 4.)</p>

<p>Whether Pamphile&rsquo;s silk gauzes were the only fine
webs of Cos,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> is a disputed question. She has the credit
of being the first to clothe victorious generals in triumphal
garments, and she has been immortalized by her cleverness
and industry. Both Aristotle and Pliny assert that
she first invented the Coan webs, and that some of them
were of silk is undoubted. The question is, How came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
it there? whence and by what route? and what country
was its original home and birthplace?</p>

<p>After stating the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of the question, how
and where did silk first make its appearance, Sir G.
Birdwood concludes that both the worm and the cocoon
were known to the Greeks and Romans, by report and
rare specimens, from the time of Alexander&rsquo;s return from
his Indian campaign.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>Of course the remains of these fabrics are extremely
scarce; and, in fact, only two are at present known to me
besides the Kertch specimen. The first is given in Semper&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Der Stil,&rdquo; and is evidently classical Greek or Roman;
but the silk material might have been effil&egrave;d from an
Oriental stuff (pl. <a href="#pl34">34</a>, No. 1). The second must have
been originally a Roman pattern, modified by the Persian
loom in which it was woven. This may have been a Roman
triumphal robe of the date of Julius C&aelig;sar (pl. <a href="#pl34">34</a>, No. 2).</p>

<p>It is clear that Chinese silken stuffs were not generally
known in Southern Europe till the time of Julius
C&aelig;sar, who displayed a profusion of silks in some of his
splendid theatrical representations.</p>

<p>How silk first arrived from the East is disputed; some
say it came by the Red Sea, and other authorities believe
it was brought from China, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Persia, by land.</p>

<p>But it is not necessary that it should have entered
our civilization by only one gate. The Periplus Maris
Erythr&aelig;i makes frequent mention of the trade in silks,
through India, by the Indus to the coasts of the
Erythrean Sea. They were also brought through Bactria
to Barygaza, near Surat, from a city called Thina
(China?). The author of the Periplus, of course, refers
to some place in the country vaguely called Serica.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>That the trade which brought it into Europe was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
difficult and limited, is proved by the fact that silk continued,
even as late as the third century of our era, to be
an article of luxury, of which the manufacture and use
continued to be the subject of legal enactments and
restrictions, for 600 years after Pamphile&rsquo;s first essay in
silk-weaving in Cos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Seres&rdquo; was the name given by the ancients to
the nation which produced silk; and it was undoubtedly
that accepted for the distant region now called China,
including Corea, and later, the kingdom of Khotan.
The first mention of these people as a distinct nation
is by Mela (iii. 7), who speaks of them as an &ldquo;honest
people, who bring what they have to sell, and return for
their payments.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>The prevailing idea amongst the Greeks was that silk
was combed from the trees. Seneca says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Nor with M&aelig;onian needle mark the web,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathered by Eastern Seres from the trees.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="poet">Seneca the Tragedian, &ldquo;Herc. &AElig;t&aelig;us,&rdquo; 644.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This was, till lately, believed to be only a fiction,
intended to hide the truth and enhance the value of the
new Coan material. But it is now ascertained that some
of the wild silk in China is carried by the silkworm round
the trees, wrapping them up, as it were, in large, untidy
cocoons; so that, as usual, tradition had truth for its
foundation.</p>

<p>There was always much mysterious report about the
new material. Dionysius Periegetes tells of a barbarous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
people called the Seres, who &ldquo;renounce the care of sheep
and oxen, but who comb the coloured flowers of the desert,
and with them produce woven precious stuffs, of which
they make figured garments, resembling the flowers of
the field in beauty, and in texture the web of the
spider.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>There is no doubt that as Egypt was the first to
weave linen, and India to produce cotton textiles, so in
China originated the material of silk and its manufacture.</p>

<p>M. Terrien de la Couperie, who has deciphered the
Archaic books of the Chinese Records, sees there excellent
linguistic proofs that the Chinese nation was originally a
fragment of the first Babylonian civilization. He there
finds that when these Accadians arrived on the furthest
eastern coast of Asia, they met with and enslaved an
aboriginal race, who already cultivated the silkworm, and
wove and worked its produce, and were called by them
&ldquo;the Embroiderers.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>This is supposed to have been an historical event
contemporary with the life of Abraham, and, therefore,
5000 years old.</p>

<p>The Chinese say that Tekin or Sin, the son of
Japhet, instructed his children in painting, sculpture, and
embroidery, and in the art of preparing <em>silk</em> for different
woven fabrics.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Whether we are justified or not in believing in so very
early a date, at any rate we must remember that it is
now ascertained that silk was used in China 2600 years
before our era.</p>

<p>Auberville says there is a legend that the Empress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
Si-ling-chi<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> (2600 <small>B.C.</small>) had the happy inspiration to
invent the unwinding of the cocoon before the insect
cut the threads; and for this discovery she was placed
among the divinities.</p>

300 years used the precious material in its mutilated
condition.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Some centuries later the Emperor Chan received tribute
in linens and silken stuffs. Tissues of many colours were
painted or richly embroidered.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>In the second century <small>A.D.</small>, a prince of Khotan,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Kiu-sa-tan-na,
was desirous of obtaining from China the eggs
of the silkworm, but his request was refused; and it
was prohibited that either eggs of the silkworm or seed
of mulberry-trees should cross the border.</p>

<p>Then the King of Khotan asked for a Chinese princess
in marriage, and this favour being granted, he found
means to inform the lady privately that in her future
kingdom she would find no silk to weave or work. The
dread of such an aimless life roused all her womanly
instincts. Defiance of the law, love of smuggling, and the
wish to please her husband and benefit her future people,
gave her courage to conceal the eggs and seeds in the
folds of her dress and the meshes of her beautiful hair, and
so she carried a most precious dower into her adopted
country.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Thus was broken the spell which for more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
than 3000 years had confined the secret of China within
the fence of its wonderful wall; and later on, <small>A.D.</small> 530,
the eggs were brought to Byzantium.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Pliny&rsquo;s account of silk and its manufacture is mostly
fanciful, though founded on half-known facts.</p>

<p>The Latin poets of the Augustan age speak of silk
attire with other luxurious customs from the East.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The
Roman senate, in the reign of Tiberius, decreed that
only women should wear silk, on account of its effeminacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
Silk was accumulated for the wardrobes of the empresses
till <small>A.D.</small> 176, when Marcus Aurelius, &ldquo;the Philosopher,&rdquo;
sold all the imperial ornaments and the silken
robes of his empress by auction in the Forum of Trajan.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>We learn that silk was precious and fabulously esteemed
to the end of the second century <small>A.D.</small>; but it is seldom
mentioned in the third century.</p>

<p>&AElig;lius Lampridius speaks of a silken cord with which
to hang himself, as an imperial extravagance on the part
of Heliogabalus (and of this only one strand was silk);
and he mentions that Alexander Severus rarely allowed
himself a dress of silk (holosericum), and only gave away
robes of partly silken substance.</p>

<p>Flavius Vopiscus says that Aurelian had no dress
wholly of silk (holosericum).<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> His wife begged him to
allow her a shawl of purple silk, and he replied, &ldquo;Far be
it from me to permit thread to be reckoned worth its
weight in gold!&rdquo;&mdash;for a pound of gold was then worth a
pound of silk.</p>

<p>Flavius Vopiscus further states that the Emperor
Carinus, however, gave away silken garments, as well
as dresses of gold and silver, to Greek artificers, players,
wrestlers, and musicians.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>A monument at Tivoli is erected to the memory of

<p>From the first to the sixth centuries, poets and historians
continually speak of silk,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> praising its beauty or
blaming it as extravagance or luxury; but according to
Yates, all the information we collect from these sources
requires to be tested as to accuracy, and is often erroneous.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the first silk-weaving in Cos, 300 <small>B.C.</small>
The first arrival of the silkworm in Europe was in the
sixth century, 900 years later. Cosmas Indicopleustes
and another monk brought eggs from China in the
hollow staves they carried in their hands. This was
a great event in European commerce. The eggs were
solemnly presented to the Emperor Justinian, and the
monopoly of their cultivation is to be found in his
law-ordaining codex.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>The monopoly of the silk manufactures was confined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
to the area of the imperial palace of Constantinople, but
the cultivation of the worm gradually spread over Greece,
Asia Minor, and India.</p>

<p>The first allusion to the use of silk in the Christian
Church is by Gregory Nazianzen (<small>A.D.</small> 370), &ldquo;Ad Hellenium
pro Monarchis Carmen:&rdquo; &ldquo;Silver and gold some
bring to God, or the fine thread by Seres spun.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Basil
illustrates the idea of the resurrection by the birth of
the butterfly from the cocoon.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Paul the Silentiary (<small>A.D.</small> 562) alludes to the frequent
use of silk in the priests&rsquo; vestments at the Church of
St. Sophia at Constantinople.</p>

<p>Bede relates that the first Abbot of Wearmouth went
to Rome for the fifth time in <small>A.D.</small> 685, and brought back
with him two scarves or palls of incomparable workmanship,
and entirely of silk, with which he purchased land
of three families at the mouth of the Wear. Bede&rsquo;s own
remains were wrapped in silk.</p>

<p>Auberville gives us, in his &ldquo;Tissus,&rdquo; specimens of
Roman silks between the first and seventh centuries,
but he cannot fix their exact date.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>The finest webs of Holosericum from the imperial
looms were generally bestowed upon the Church, and
thus consecrated, the earliest ascertained specimens that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
have survived have been preserved; and of these, most
have been found in the tombs of saints, bishops, and
kings who were buried in priestly as well as in royal
garments.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Among the silk and satin fabrics, the tissue called
&ldquo;Imperial&rdquo; is mentioned by several early English authors.
Roger de Wendover and Matthew Paris describe the
apparition of King John as clad in &ldquo;royal robes of
Imperial.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> William de Magna Villa brought from
Greece, in 1170, a stuff called Imperial, &ldquo;marbled&rdquo; or
variegated, and covered with lions woven in gold.</p>

<p>In the Eastern Empire, this industry after a time fell
into the hands of the Jews; and in 1161, Benjamin of
Tudela says the city of Thebes contained about 2000
Jewish silk-weavers.</p>

<p>The breeding of the worm in Europe seems to have
been confined to Greece from the time of Justinian to
the twelfth century; but in 1148, Roger, King of Sicily,
brought as prisoners of war, from Corinth, Thebes, and
Athens, many silk-weavers, and settled them at Palermo.
&ldquo;Then might be seen Corinthians and Thebans of both
sexes, employed in weaving velvet stoles interwoven
with gold, and serving like the Eretrians of old among
the Persians.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Hugh Falcandus<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> has left a description of the Royal
manufactory at Palermo, and the Hotel de Tiraz which absorbed
all the smaller Saracenic factories already started.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
The Hotel de Tiraz had four great workshops, in which
were separately carried on the weaving of plain tissues,
velvets, examits and satins, and flowered stuffs (damasks),
and lastly, gold brocades and embroideries. It was from
the last that proceeded the real works of art, and the
embroideries with pearls and precious stones.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The
highest efforts of the loom were apparently finished with
the needle,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> as in the figured textiles of Egypt.</p>

<p>The continuity of Sicilian textile designs from the sixth
to the sixteenth centuries (a thousand years) is very
remarkable. Owing to its originally strongly stamped
Oriental character, great knowledge of the arts of weaving,
spinning, and dyeing silk is required to enable any one to
assign an exact date to materials which only remodelled
their style three times.</p>

<p>Dr. Rock&rsquo;s rules for deciphering these three dates
may, however, be easily learned, as they are broad and
simple. In his comprehensive &ldquo;Introduction to the
Textiles in the Kensington Museum&rdquo; (p. lxvii) he says
that the three defined periods of silk-weaving in Sicily
are: First, from the time of Justinian to the Hohenstaufen
(from the sixth to the twelfth century); secondly,
from the accession of Frederick I. (Barbarossa), 1152,
to Charles IV., 1347 (twelfth to fourteenth centuries);
the third period is of one century only, from 1347 to 1456.</p>

<p>The first period especially shows African animals,
such as the giraffe and the different kinds of antelopes,
mixed with Arabian mottoes; and the patterns are
generally woven with gold. This is merely gilt parchment,
the silk being mingled with cotton.</p>

<p class="caption">Peacock Pattern. Silk Wrapping on the body of St. Cuthbert. Durham.</p>

<p>The second period, beginning in the twelfth century,
shows the arrival of Count Roger&rsquo;s Persian and Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
workmen, captives from Thebes, Corinth, and Athens.
The fresh designs show fragments of Greek taste, such
as masks and foliage, and give one a slight foretaste of
the Renaissance.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>These semi-classical echoes are contemporary in the
Sicilian looms with such Norman motives as a crowned
sovereign riding with a hawk upon his wrist.</p>

<p>This description singularly applies to the relics removed
from the tomb of St. Cuthbert, at Durham, in 1827; among
which are fragments of three wrappings, or garments
of silk, so suggestive of the artistic traditions of many
nationalities, and the long descent of patterns, recognizable
after the lapse of centuries, that a description of them,
accompanied by illustrations, can hardly fail to be interesting.
They are all now reduced by time to a rich golden
brown, though there are indications that blue, green, and
red have been woven into their fabric, and there are also
on one of them traces of gilding. The first (plate <a href="#pl35">35</a>)
shows Oriental conventional peacocks, double-headed and
collared, framed within circles which slightly intersect
each other, thus giving the opportunity for varying the
original motive by breaking up the rolling arabesqued
pattern, and uniting the stems and flowers contained in
the border. The spaces between the circles are filled
in with gryphons in pairs, of the Babylonian stamp, thick
limbed with strongly-marked muscles. There is a border
or guimp, Persian in character, in which are small crosses
surmounting repetitions of the crenelated pattern found
in Assyrian ornament.</p>

<p>The second piece of silk contains a large rosace.
Scattered about it are repetitions of the Persian leaf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
or tree of life, and the border consists of kneeling
hares or fawns between a Persian arabesque and a corded
line. The mixture of Egyptian and Assyrian styles is
remarkable throughout, till we come to the centre of the
rosace, where we find a most incongruous man in armour
on horseback with a hawk on his wrist, giving the Norman
stamp of the reigning house and influence in Sicily.
The central subject is exactly repeated on an embroidered
twelfth century chasuble in the treasury of the Cathedral
of Bamberg, only that a royal crown and robes are worn
by the horseman (pl. <a href="#pl36">36</a>).<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>The third specimen is the most noteworthy (plate
<a href="#pl37">37</a>). There is nothing of Assyrian here, but it reminds
one of Egyptian and Greek art, and at once suggests
Count Roger&rsquo;s Greek slaves at the Sicilian looms, but
the design is probably of a much earlier date, and the
subject is puzzling. A piece of drapery resembling an
Egyptian sail with its fringes<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> (pl. <a href="#pl38">38</a>) is looped up on
each side to the head of a thyrsus, and above it hangs a
large cluster of fruits. The lower part of the drapery
rests upon water, and is somewhat like a boat, with ducks
swimming towards it, and fish disporting themselves in
the rippling waves. Between the circles the ducks are
repeated, facing a shield enriched with rows of the crenelated
pattern surmounted by a vine.</p>

<p>These fragments have belonged each to a very large
and freely woven silk shawl or mantle. The circles are
about two feet across. There is a different arrangement
of the threads in each web, giving different fine diapers,
and the last described has a raised pattern which might
have been intended to represent water.</p>

It is most likely that in the twelfth century, or even a
little later, the body of St. Cuthbert was wrapped in these
shawls, and so left when at the Reformation, his shrine
was destroyed, and the coffer containing his remains
buried in the same place, and piously concealed till our
own day. I shall describe the beautiful embroideries in
which the body had been clothed in the tenth century
when I come to the subject of English work.</p>

<p>The third period of silk-weaving art is unmistakably
Sicilian. At the end of the thirteenth century and
beginning of the fourteenth, Palermo struck out her own
line. The Greek cross appears in various forms. The
designs are of a wonderful richness and capricious ingenuity.
They show alike Asiatic, African, and European
animals, and every kind of mythological creature&mdash;griffins,
dragons, dogs, and harts, with large wings;
swans, pheasants, and eagles, single or double-headed,
often pecking at the sun&rsquo;s rays; beautifully drawn foliage
and flowers, and heraldic emblems and coats-of-arms.
One peculiarity of the third period is the frequent use of
green patterns on &ldquo;murrey&rdquo;-coloured grounds.</p>

<p>All this splendour of design was commonly lavished
on poor material. The silks continued to be mixed with
cotton, and the gold, or rather the gilding, was so base
that it has almost always become black on the foundation
strips of parchment or paper.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
The heraldic silks are mostly of the time of the Crusades,
when the distinguished pilgrims and warriors, especially
the English, made Sicily their half-way house to the Holy
Land, and brought from thence fabrics woven to suit
their tastes. In Auberville&rsquo;s book we find, under the
dates of many centuries, the most remarkable fragments
now known. On portrait-tombs and in some very ancient
pictures are figured beautiful silks woven in gold, which
are recognizable at once by their Arab-Sicilian style.
Of this type, the remarkable fragment of the dress of
Richard II., in the Kensington Museum, dates itself,
by carrying the cognizances of his grandfather and his
mother, and the portrait of his dog Math.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>The last period of the Sicilian silks is especially marked
by the inscriptions being mostly nonsense, and only
woven in as ornament, with the forms of Arab lettering.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>Sir G. Birdwood says that whether the Saracens
found the manufacture of silk already established in
India or not, they certainly influenced the decorative
designs. He adds that kincobs are now woven at
Ahmedabad and Benares, identical in design with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
old Sicilian brocades; while the Saracenic Sicilian silks
abound in patterns which prove their origin in Assyrian,
Sassanian, or Indian art.</p>

<p>We know that the Saracens introduced colonies of
Persian, and probably Indian workmen into Spain, after
the beginning of the ninth century, to assist them in their
architecture and textile manufactures, and in return the
Mogul emperors of Delhi invited many Italian and
French designers into India.</p>

<p>The Taj and other buildings in Rajpootana are
decorated with exquisite mosaics coeval with those of
Austin of Bordeaux. Their styles of art in textiles, and
in other materials, have acted and reacted upon each
other; and nothing throws more light on the affinities
and the development of the modern decorative arts of
Europe than the history of the introduction, under
Justinian, of the silk manufactures from the East into
the West.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>From Palermo, all the stages of the manufacture of
silk spread themselves over Italy and into Spain. According
to Nicolo Tegrini, the flourishing silk-weavers
of Lucca having been ejected from the city in the early
part of the fourteenth century, carried their art elsewhere,
and even to Germany, France, and Britain.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Italian weavers went to Lyons in 1450, and so started
the silk industry that it has steadily increased till now.
It gives employment to about 31,000 looms and 240,000
workpeople of both sexes.</p>

<p>The Moors, when they overflowed into Iberia, carried
with them all their Orientalisms, traditions, manufactures,
and designs; thus disobeying their prophet, who forbade
the use of silk except to women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
Senhor F. de Riano tells us that from the ninth to
the eleventh centuries, Spain was producing fine silk
tissues. The Moorish Cordovese writer, Ash-Shakandi,
who lived in the beginning of the thirteenth century,
says, &ldquo;Malaga is famous for its manufactures of silks of
all colours and patterns, some of which are so rich that
a suit made of them will cost many thousands. Such
are the brocades with beautiful designs and the names
of the Caliphs, Ameers, and other wealthy people woven
into them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>The same author, speaking of the manufactures of silk
at Almeria, says that thence came the brightest colours;
and Al-Makhari adds a list of precious silk tissues,
naming the &ldquo;Tiraz,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Iscalaton,&rdquo; and the robes called
each by its own special name.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Ash-Shakandi also mentions
the looms of Murcia, and its carpets.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>When the Moors were driven from Spain, the silk
works of Malaga and Almeria were ruined. But those
of Valencia became famous, and flourish to this day.
Talavera della Reina also produces fine ecclesiastical
fabrics, and at Toledo the ancient traditions are preserved,
and they still weave sixteenth-century designs.</p>

<p>In Italy, Genoa, Florence, and Milan followed the
Sicilian silk manufactures, and each has left specimens
of the craft, of which Rock has pointed out the marked
individualities.</p>

<p>The rich stuffs with inscriptions inwoven in gold, in
the Middle Ages, were called &ldquo;literatis.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
The designs of Lucca at first imitated the Moorish
Sicilian type; and introduced as their speciality, white
figures, such as angels in white garments, and exchanged
the Oriental intricate patterns for a bolder and simpler
style.</p>

<p>Venice, of course, also showed at first the Oriental
impress; but she soon struck out a line of her own; and
her especial invention was shown in weaving, from the
thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries, square pieces of
silken tissue, representing sacred subjects.</p>

<p>Florentine tissues, especially their velvet and gold
brocades, were particularly splendid, and can be recognized
by the loops of gold thread drawn to the surface
and left there. Of these early Florentine gold brocades
we have still beautiful examples in the palls of our City
companies and in ancient ecclesiastical vestments. The
loops of gold have been the custom since the thirteenth
century, and still prevail in certain traditional fabrics, for
instance, in the banners woven annually for the prizes
at the horse races in Florence. The Corsini family, who
have for many generations and for hundreds of years
competed in these races, had, in their princely palace
at Rome, a room entirely hung with the silk of these
gorgeous banners.</p>

<p>In Hungary, Queen Gisela, in the eleventh century,
established looms for weaving silk; and many convents
throughout Europe and in England wove silken tissues
for the service of the Church, till the great manufactures
absorbed these partially private enterprises.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Individual exertion produced copies, or motives that
are taken from Eastern, Southern, or Northern inspirations;
but it is only in large national schools of arts
or crafts that an absolutely recognizable style becomes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
apparent. For example, the early French silks from
monastic establishments are not remarkable for either
style or texture till the sixteenth century, when they
came to the front as a national manufacture, and have held
the highest place in silk-weaving ever since.</p>

<p>The Flemish towns of Ypres, Ghent, and Mechlin
were known for their silken webs in the thirteenth century,
and at that time innumerable small schools of the craft
seem to have covered Europe. They are constantly
named in the lists of fine furnishings in Germany. In
England, France, and Germany, as well as in the Low
Countries, each convent had, besides its silk-weaving
looms, its workshops for embroideries on silk, woollens,
and linens, borrowing from the Byzantine Empire, Sicily,
and Spain, their designs and patterns.</p>

<p>About this time (the thirteenth century), Marco Polo
resided and travelled in Asia. He visited the principal
cities of Syria, Persia, Khotan, and Cathay, and from
him we have information of the different Asiatic textiles,
generally bearing the name of the city where they were
woven. He names, for instance, the medi&aelig;val &ldquo;baudas&rdquo;
and &ldquo;baudakin&rdquo; (with endless modifications in the spelling),
from Baghdad. This afterwards gave the word
baldachino to the awning or canopy over the altar,
which it retained even when textiles had given place to
marbles and mosaics.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Satin is only found named in catalogues about the
fourteenth century. But the dalmatic of Charlemagne,
at Rome, is embroidered on a stout blue satin, and has
never been transferred; and at Constantinople, Baldwin
II., at his coronation in 1204, was shod and clothed in
vermilion satin embroidered with jewels; while all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
Venetian and French barons present were clad in satin.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
Semper and Bock believe that it had been a Chinese
material long before it reached Europe.</p>

<p>Satin was often called &ldquo;blattin,&rdquo; in connection with the
colour of the cochineal insect (blatta), whose dye was
invariably used for satin. We cannot tell, however, which
was certainly named from the other.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>In the poem of &ldquo;The Lady of the Fountain,&rdquo; translated
by Lady Charlotte Guest from the Welsh ballads of the
thirteenth century, silk and satin are often named. At
the opening of the poem, King Arthur is described
seated on a throne of rushes, covered with a flame-coloured
satin cloth, and with a red satin cushion under
his elbow.</p>

<p>Fiery red was the orthodox colour for satin. In
old German poems we find it described as &ldquo;pfellat,&rdquo;
always as being fiery. One kind of pfellat was called
salamander.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Bruges satins were the most esteemed in
the Middle Ages. Chaucer speaks of &ldquo;satin riche and
newe.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>Satin and velvet are the contrasting silken materials.
In satin the threads are laid along so that the shining
surface ripples with every ray of sunshine, and the
shadows are melted into half-lights by the reflections from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
every fold. It makes a dazzling garment, splendid in its
radiant sheen; whereas in velvet, where each thread is
placed upright and shorn smoothly, all light is absorbed and
there are no reflections, and the whole effects are solemn,
rich, and deep.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Some of the oldest velvets resemble
plush in the length of their pile, and have not the dignity of
velvet.</p>

<p>Semper, from the different derivations that have been
suggested, selects the connection of the word &ldquo;velvet&rdquo;
(German, <i>Felbert</i>) with &ldquo;welf,&rdquo; the skin or fur of an animal.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Among the gifts to Charlemagne (ninth century) from
Haroun el Raschid were velvets; and the earliest existing
specimen we know of is named by Bock as being in the
Pergament Codex at Le Puy, in Vend&ocirc;me, where,
amongst other curious interleaved specimens of weaving,
is a fine piece of shorn silk velvet.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>Marco Polo, in the thirteenth century, frequently speaks
of velvet as an Asiatic fabric. It is first known as a
European textile in Lucca, about 1295, and we may
therefore say that it was imported from the East.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>In the next chapter on <a href="#Page_175">colour</a> I have noticed the
curious fact that the word purple was sometimes used
to mean colour, and sometimes to express the texture
of velvet, thus confounding the two; but I have also
pointed out that it had other meanings, and had become
a very comprehensive word for everything that expressed
richness and warmth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
While examining and judging embroideries, we must
be careful not to be deceived by the different dates often
occurring in the grounding and the applied materials.
Much embroidery was worked on fabrics that were
already old and even worn out; and others have been
transferred centuries ago, and perhaps more than once, to
fresh grounds.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>This sometimes causes a good deal of difficulty in
dating specimens. One should begin by ascertaining
whether the needlework was originally intended to be cut
out (<i>opus consutum</i>), and so laid on a ground of another
material, and worked down and finished there.</p>

<p>Of course it is always evident and easily ascertained,
whether the work has been transferred at all. If so&mdash;and
from each succeeding transference&mdash;small fragments may
be found showing on the cut edges. You will often see
remains of two or more of these layers, reminding you
of the three Trojan cities dug up at different depths under
each other at Hissarlik.</p>

<p>In judging each specimen the acumen of the expert
is needed to obtain a correct opinion, and he should
not only be an arch&aelig;ologist, but a botanist and a herald
besides;<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> and, in fact, no kind of knowledge is useless in
deciphering the secrets of human art. But even when
so armed, he is often checked and puzzled by some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
accidental caprice of design or mode of weaving, and
after wasting trouble and time, has to cast it aside as
defying classification.</p>

<p>It is, however, as well to note these exceptions, as, when
compared, they sometimes explain each other.</p>

<p>What I have said regards, of course, the historical and
arch&aelig;ological side of the study of textiles, and I have
treated of them as being either the origin or the imitations
of different styles of embroidery, and so inseparably
connected with the art which is the subject and motive of
this book; and not only in this does the connection
between them exist, but in the fact that as embroideries
always need a ground, silken and other textiles are an
absolute necessity to their existence.</p>

<p>For these reasons alone I have given this chapter on
materials, short and imperfect, but suggesting further
research into the writings of the authors I have quoted,
and, I hope, exciting the interest of the reader.</p>

Molochinus, or malva silvestris (wild hemp), Yates, pp. 292-317, is
sometimes spoken of as a mallow, sometimes as a nettle. In the
Vocabulary of Papias (<small>A.D.</small> 1050) it is said that the cloth called molocina
is made from thread of mallow, and used for dress in Egypt. Garments
of molochinus were brought from India, according to the Periplus (see
Pliny, 146, 166, 170, 171). It was seldom used by the ancients, but both
Greeks and Romans made it serve for mats and ropes. The Thracians
wove of it garments and sheets. It is not named in the Scriptures.</p>

&ldquo;Camoca&rdquo; or caman in the Middle Ages is supposed to have been
of camels&rsquo; hair, mixed with silk. Edward the Black Prince left to
his confessor his bed of red caman, with his arms embroidered on each
corner. Rock (p. xliv) gives us information about the tents and garments
of camels&rsquo; hair found throughout the East, wherever the camel flourishes
and has a fine hairy winter coat, which it sheds in the heat. The
coarser parts are used for common purposes, and the finest serve for
beautiful fabrics, especially shawls. Marco Polo tells of beautiful
camelots manufactured from the hair of camels; and of the Egyptian
coarse and very fine fabrics woven of the same materials.</p>

The sheep of Tarentum, from the days of the Greek colonists, were
famed, as they are still, for the warm brown tints on their black wool.
Pliny says that this is caused by the weed <i>fumio</i>, on which they

there the wool is so tinged by the plant now called <i>fumolo</i>, which

&ldquo;Textrinum Antiquorum,&rdquo; pp. 267-80. A peculiarity of Egyptian
linen is that it was often woven with more threads in the warp
than in the woof. A specimen in the Indian Museum, South Kensington,
shows in its delicate texture 140 threads in the inch to the warp,
and 64 to the woof. Another piece of fine linen has 270 to the warp,
and 110 to the woof. Generally there are twice or three times as many
threads, but sometimes even four times the number. Wilkinson gives
a probable reason for this peculiarity. See Wilkinson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ancient
Egyptians,&rdquo; vol. i. chap. ix. pp. 121-226. See Rock&rsquo;s Introduction, p. xiv.</p>

Rock, p. xxv. Yates (p. 3) says they cut their gold for wearing
apparel into thin plates, and did not draw it into wire, as it is translated
in the Vulgate (Exodus xxxix.). The ephod made by Bezaleel was of
fine linen, gold, violet, purple, and scarlet, twice dyed, with embroidered
work. This tradition must have guided the artist who designed the
ephod in the National Museum at Munich, in the seventeenth century,
for a prince boy-bishop.</p>

There is a very ancient local tradition at Sh&#365;sh, that <small>A.D.</small> 640, in the

victorious general, it was placed in one of glass, and moored to the
bridge which spanned the branch of the Euphrates flowing between
the two halves of the city, so that the waters flowed over it. See

buttons (for we can give them no other name), with crosses and hearts

In Aikin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of James I.,&rdquo; p. 205, we have a curious account of
the monopoly of gold thread, that had been granted, with others, to
George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham. The thread was so scandalously
debased with copper as to corrode the hands of the artificers, and even
the flesh of those who wore it. This adulterated article they sold at an
exorbitant price, and if they detected any one making a cheaper or
better article, they were empowered to fine or imprison them, while a
clause in their patent protected themselves. The manufacturers of this
base metal thread were two Frenchmen, Mompesson and Michel, and
Edward Villiers, the Marquis&rsquo; brother, was one of the firm. Doubtless
they drove for a time a roaring trade, as gold embroideries were then
universally worn, both by men and women; but the House of Commons
interfered, and the monopoly was abolished.</p>

The School of Gold Embroidery at Munich produces work of a
richness and precision which has, perhaps, never been excelled. The
raised parts of the design are first cast in soft hollow &ldquo;carton,&rdquo; and the
gold is worked on it and into the recesses with the help of a fine
stiletto, which pioneers the needle for each stitch. This is embroidery
&ldquo;on the stamp,&rdquo; but without padding.</p>

Yates says, pp. 160-162: &ldquo;Whether silk was mentioned in the Old
Testament cannot, perhaps, be determined. After fully considering the
subject, Braunius decides against silk being known to the Hebrews in
ancient times (&lsquo;De Vestitu Heb. Sacerdotum,&rsquo; i. c. viii.).&rdquo; The contrary
opinion is founded on the passage, &ldquo;I clothed thee with broidered
work, and shod thee with badger-skins. I girded thee about with fine
linen, and covered thee with silk&rdquo; (<i>meshi</i>).&mdash;Ezekiel xvi. But the
translation is disputed.</p>

Yates (pp. 173, 174) believes that &ldquo;Cos&rdquo; should always be read

also been substituted for the name of &ldquo;Cos,&rdquo; the island.</p>

While in Europe the arts of daily use and decoration were struggling
for life after many interruptions and revolutions, the civilization of
Japan, which is nearly contemporary with Christianity, spent itself in
perfecting to the most exquisite finish the arts which had been imported
from China and Corea. Japan also inherited the power and the
tradition of concealment, and so Europe remained unconscious, until
the last century, of the miraculous arts which a semi-barbarous people
were cultivating&mdash;<em>not</em> for commercial purposes. Auberville, &ldquo;Tissus,&rdquo;

Auberville, Plate 4. Amongst these are what he calls &ldquo;Consular silks.&rdquo;
These are, or may be, included in the palmated class, as they are
evidently woven for triumphal occasions. One of the most remarkable
has every mark of Oriental design. It represents a picture in a circle,
repeated over and over again, of a warrior in his quadriga. Black or
coloured slaves drive the horses, either running beside them or standing
upon them; and other slaves carry beasts on their shoulders, and are
stooping to give them drink at a trough. The space between the
circles is filled in with the tree of life, growing out of its two horns.
The colours are purple and gold. He places this between the first and
seventh centuries (see pl. <a href="#pl34">34</a>).</p>

The Crusaders carried away splendid booty from the towns they
took and ransacked. As it was the great gathering-place of all Eastern
and Western nations, Jerusalem was a mart for rich merchandise from
Persia, Arabia, Syria, and Ph&oelig;nicia, till the times of the Latin kings.
Antioch, as well as Jerusalem, yielded the richest plunder. Matthew
Paris (a contemporary historian), speaking of what was taken at Antioch,
1098, says, &ldquo;At the division of costly vessels, crosses, weavings, and
silken stuffs, every beggar in the crusading army was enriched.&rdquo;
Alexandria, as early as the middle of the sixth century, <small>A.D.</small>, had been
the dep&ocirc;t for the silken stuffs of Libya and Morocco. Here is a wide
area opened to us for suggestions as to the origin and traditions of

twelfth and thirteenth centuries. I have already mentioned it as a
textile in the chapter on <a href="#Page_137">cotton</a>. When woven of silk it belongs to the
class of velvets.</p>

Elsewhere I have spoken of the embroideries of the early Christian
times found in the Fayoum, in Egypt. These afford notable examples
of the ancient method in putting in patches on a worn or frayed
garment. They invariably embroidered them, and so added a grace to
the old and honoured vestment, and justified the classical appellation,
&ldquo;Healer of clothes&rdquo; for a darner. The comparatively modern
additions of the restorer, are in ancient as in later specimens, often a
puzzle to the arch&aelig;ologist.</p>

The specimens in the South Kensington Museum, where Dr. Rock
gives their approximate dates, are most useful to the student of this
subject.</p>

<h3>COLOUR.</h3>

<span class="i0">To hue and radiance God has given!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="poet">Cautley, &ldquo;Emblems,&rdquo; p. 21.</p>
</div>


<p>It is my intention to confine myself to the discussion
of colour, in as far as it belongs to the dyes of textiles and
the materials for embroidery. I will adhere as closely
as I can to this part of what is a great and most interesting
subject&mdash;one which the science of to-day has opened
out, and by the test of experiment, cleared of erroneous
theories; revealing to us all its beauty and fitness for
the use and delight of man.</p>

<p>As through all ages the eye has been gradually
educated to appreciate <em>harmony</em> in colour, so <em>dissonance</em>&mdash;that
is, what errs against harmony&mdash;hurts us, without
apparently a sufficient reason; and we have to seek the
causes of our sensations in the scientific works and lectures
of Professor Tyndall and others.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the appreciation of colour has
belonged in different degrees to the eye of every animal,
but especially to that of man, ever since light first painted
the flowers of the field. The eye is created to see
colour, as well as form. But we know that men, being
accustomed to acquiesce in the powers with which they
find themselves gifted by nature, enjoy and use them,
long before they begin to study, classify, and name them.</p>

<p>When we recollect that the circulation of the blood
was not known within the last three hundred years, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
that Albert D&uuml;rer painted the skeleton Death on the
bridge of Lucerne, with one bone in the upper and one
in the lower arm, we shall be surprised to find that the
ancients had named the colours they saw, with some
degree of descriptive and scientific precision. The word
&ldquo;purple,&rdquo; for instance, covered a multitude of tints, which
had not as yet been differentiated, either in common parlance
or in poetry,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> though as articles of commerce the
purple tints had been early distinguished.</p>

<p>What names have we now, in this present advanced
day, for defining tastes or smells? We say that something
smells like a violet, or a rose, or a sea breeze, or a
frosted cabbage. We say a smell is nice or nasty, that
a taste is delicious or nauseous; but beyond calling it
sweet or sour, we have no descriptive words for either
smells or tastes, whereas the nations who traded in
the materials for dyes exchanged their nomenclatures,
which we can recognize from the descriptive remarks of
different authors.</p>

<p>Colour, as an art, was born in those lands which
cluster round the eastern shores of the Mediterranean&mdash;the
northern coasts of Syria and Arabia, and the isles
of Greece. All art grew in that area, and all its
adjuncts and materials there came to perfection,
though often imported from more southern and eastern
sources.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>E. Curtius says that the science of colour came into
Europe with the Ph&oelig;nicians and accompanied the worship
of Astarte. This, of course, applies to artistic
textiles, as the Greeks had already acquired the art of
dyeing for plain weaving. Numa, in his regulations for
necessary weaving, refers also to colour. The Italians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
therefore must at that time have made some advance in
the art, especially the Etruscans.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>The infinity of variation in colour is difficult to
imagine. The chemists of the Gobelins have fixed and
catalogued 4480 tones. Besides, we must not forget that
it is now all but ascertained that the same colour is
probably appreciated differently by nearly every eye.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>How the eye accepts colours and conveys them to the
mind is still a question in dispute, though the theories of
Tyndall, Helmholz, Hering, Charpentier, and others,
aided by experiments, are drawing ascertained facts into
a circle, which will ere long be complete, and the
mysteries of colour may be ascertained.</p>

<p>Probably the effects of colour on educated minds are
as various as the tints and shades of tones of the many
substances which receive them,&mdash;reflected from all surrounding
objects, blazing in light, or softened by shadow,&mdash;fresh
and glowing, or permanently faded&mdash;shining
with modern varnish, or sobered by the dust of ages.</p>

<p>It is the art of the colourist, whether he paints pictures,
or dyes textiles, or embroiders them, to reduce the tints of
the prism to an endurable and delightful lowness of tone,
while preserving as far as possible all their light and purity.</p>

<p>Prismatic colours are so radiantly glorious, that when
we see the rainbow in the sky it is each time a joyful
surprise. The most stolid natures are moved by it; we
have even seen our dog staring at it.</p>

<p>When, in experiments on light, the shafts of colour are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
thrown on the wall, they are greeted with shouts of
admiration; but these glories are veiled to us by the fact
that the eye cannot dissect the prismatic ray without the
assistance of the instrument that has revealed it. This is
a merciful arrangement; for we are not fitted to live in
a prismatic display, any more than in a continuity of
lightning flashes. We should go mad or blind if exposed
to either.</p>

<p>Science has shown us the perfect beauty of colour
without form, the soothing pleasures of its harmonies, and
the delightful surprises of its contrasts. From the
glimpses we have of its nature and laws, we may hope
for fresh inspiration for the art of the colourist.</p>

<p>Though it is true that each eye, even when educated,
retains its own special appreciation of the colours that
gratify its seeing nerve, yet there are certain standards
which give almost universal pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The blind and the colour-blind must remain exceptions
for all time; and there are many gradations in colour-blindness,
till we come to the normal class of seeing eyes;
and passing them by, reach to those few men, gifted
beyond all others with that fund of sensitive eye-nerve
and mental power, which enables them to create new
thoughts in colour.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Titian and his school arose from
the inherited science and tradition, and carefully prepared
pigments of his immediate predecessors, acting on an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
exceptional eye and mind, imbued with the splendours of
the early mornings and the sunsets in the glowing
atmosphere of Venice.</p>

<p>Colour has long been supposed to convey certain
impressions to the mind. The absence of all colour,
which we call &ldquo;black,&rdquo; symbolizes in dress, grief, pride,
or dignity; according as it drapes the mourner, the
Spanish grandee, or the priest.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Yellow being the colour
of the sun and of corn and gold, represents riches,
generosity, and light. Red stands between the dark and
the lively colours, and represents warmth and animation,
dignity, splendour, life, love, and joy.</p>

<p>The expression of blue is that of purity. It recalls the
distant sky, the calm ocean, and has an immortal and
celestial character. It ascends to the highest and descends
to the lowest tones of <i>chiaro-oscuro</i>. Nothing so nearly
approaches pure white as the palest blue; nothing is
so nearly black as the darkest.</p>

<p>Green has been assigned by nature the place of the
universal background. It is the complementary colour
of red, softening and assimilating it by reflected shadows,
and setting off the glory of every flower and fruit. The
expression of green is gaiety and modesty, light and tenderness,
shadow and repose, to both the eye and the mind.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>It must be allowed that it is by the earliest associations
of the individual, or by those derived from the family, the
tribe or the nation, that colours are connected with such
attributes welded by art and time into traditional meanings,
which they absolutely possess,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> and from which fashion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
cannot disconnect them; such, for instance, is the royalty
of purple.</p>

<p>The word purple is so indiscriminately used as a
poetic epithet, rather than as a distinctive appellation,
that much confusion has been caused by it. Historically,
among the Persians, Greeks, and Romans it appears to
have been simply the royal colour, varying from the purest
blue, through every shade of violet, down to the deepest
crimson. Sometimes, poetically, &ldquo;purple&rdquo; seems to have
described only a surface. The breezy or stormy sea was
purple; the sky was purple; the hyacinthine locks of
Narcissus, the rosy lips of Venus were purple. As a
textile, velvet was purple, even when it was white.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The epithets &ldquo;purple&rdquo; and &ldquo;wine-coloured&rdquo; are often
bestowed on the Mediterranean Sea, and are justified by
its occasional hue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;As from the clouds, deep-bosom&rsquo;d, swell&rsquo;d with showers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="poet">Pope&rsquo;s Homer, &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; b. xi. v. 383.</p>
</div>

<p>Professor Tyndall suggests that the soft green of the
sea, shadowed by clouds, assumes a subjective purple hue.
Homer must have observed this before he became blind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
Pliny gives us much information about this colour; he
enumerates the different sea-shores and coasts, Egyptian,
Asiatic, and European, whence came the shell-fish (the
murex and pelagia) that produced the so-called Tyrian
purple dyes.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>He says that Romulus wore the purple, and that
the dyed garments, all purple, were sacred to the
gods in those days. After saying that it was still a
colour of distinction, he continues: &ldquo;Let us be prepared
to excuse the frantic passion for purple, though we are
impelled to inquire why such a high value is placed on
the produce of this fish, seeing that in the dye the smell
of it is offensive, and the colour, of a greenish hue,
resembles the sea when tempestuous.&rdquo; He describes
purples<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> as being differently coloured according as to
whether these &ldquo;conchylia&rdquo; inhabited the sea mud, the
reefs, or the pebbly shores, the last being the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
valuable.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> This purple, said to have been imported
from the coasts of Tyre, was till lately sold in Rome for its
weight in gold; it gave the burning rosy red dye of
the Cardinal&rsquo;s robes, and was called &ldquo;Porpora encarnadina,&rdquo;
purple incarnadine. It is full of light and
freshness, and never fades; in fact, it has all the
qualities ascribed to it by Pliny. It intensifies in the
light.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>After purple, scarlet was the colour most esteemed by
the ancients. The Israelites must have carried with
them the dyes which coloured the hangings, woven or
embroidered, belonging to the sanctuary in the wilderness,
of which the outer covering of rams&rsquo; skins was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
dyed scarlet, and was probably of the nature of red
morocco.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>There was the mineral dye, (cinnabar or red sulphate
of mercury), and the insect dye; the first was probably
used in mural painting. It is translated in our Bible as
vermilion, in the account given by Jeremiah of a &ldquo;house,
ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Also
Ezekiel gives us another instance of house-painting
in vermilion.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Homer, who as a rule does not describe
colouring, says the Greek ships were painted red.</p>

<p>It is probable that cinnabar was tempered, by admixture
of white or other colours, for the monochrome painting of
the Egyptians and Greeks. It was called by the Greeks
miltos, by the Romans minium.</p>

<p>The dye of the red portions of the funeral tent of
Queen Isi-em-Kheb, Shishak&rsquo;s mother-in-law, is found
by analysis to be composed of hematite (peroxyde of iron)
tempered with lime. This is a beautiful pink red.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>The mineral red now called vermilion must have
borrowed its name from the insect dye which the Greeks
and Romans called &ldquo;kermes.&rdquo; In the Middle Ages the
dye from the kermes was still called &ldquo;vermiculata,&rdquo; of
which the word vermilion is a literal translation.</p>

<p>We should be fortunate if we could find how the Greeks
and Romans prepared the cinnabar for mural painting, of
which we find remnants in ruins and tombs&mdash;a lovely and
pure red, with a tender bloom on it like a fragment of the
rainbow, and not the slightest shade of yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
One of the most beautiful specimens of this scarlet
that I am acquainted with, is a small drinking-cup (a
&ldquo;rhyton&rdquo;) at the British Museum, in the form of a sphinx,
with a white face, gilded hair, and a little cap of pure
cinnabar, which is so soft in tone that it suggests the
texture of scarlet velvet.</p>

<p>Cochineal, which was first brought from America in the
sixteenth century, has now replaced almost every other
scarlet dye for textiles.</p>

<p>Crimson is once mentioned in Chronicles as karmel,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
which may mean the dye of the kermes insect;<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
and from this the word crimson is legitimately derived.
Whether the scarlet coupled with it is a vegetable, mineral,
or insect colour, we have no means of ascertaining.
&ldquo;Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white
as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall be as
wool.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>From what Pliny says, it appears that some green dyes
were produced from a green clay; others from metals.
Copper furnished the most beautiful shades.</p>

<p>Blue has always been extracted from indigo. Pliny tells
us that the Ph&oelig;nicians brought it from Barbarike, in
the Indies, to Egypt; and he quotes the &ldquo;Periplus&rdquo; on
this subject. He gives an amusing report that indigo is
a froth collected round the stems of certain reeds; but he
was aware of its characteristic property, that of emitting
a beautiful purple vapour when submitted to great heat;
and he says it smells like the sea. The Egyptians likewise
extracted blues from copper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
Yellow was anciently, in Egypt, sometimes a vegetable
and sometimes a mineral dye. Browns and blacks were
prepared from several substances, especially pine wood
and the contents of tombs burned into a kind of
charcoal.</p>

<p>We find that lime, chalk, white lead, and other mineral
substances were employed by the ancients for the different
approaches to dazzling whiteness. That of the lily, the
emblem of purity, can only be emulated in textile or
pictorial art by opaque substances reduced as much as
possible by bleaching to the last expression of the colour
of the raw material. Nothing that is transparent can be
really white, as colours are seen through it, as well as the
reflected lights on the two surfaces.</p>

<p>In painting, we can produce the effect of whiteness in
different ways, leading by the gradation of tender colours
and shadows up to a high light. But in textile art,
which is essentially flat, it is necessary to pursue a different
method, and that of isolation is the most simple and
effective, and was well understood in Egypt, Greece, and
India. The white pattern, or flower, is surrounded with
a fine dark line (black is the best), which effectually separates
it from all the surrounding colours, and gives it the
effect of light, even when the whiteness retains enough of
the natural colour of the raw material to tone it down very
perceptibly. The eye accepts it as white, and ignores
the tint that pervades it, and is hardly to be expelled
from silk or wool. Linen and cotton are the whitest of
materials, after passing through the hands of the chemist
or the bleacher.</p>

<p>It is amusing to observe that Pliny regarded colours,
whether vegetable or mineral, rather as useful for the
pharmacopeia of his day, than as dyes or artistic pigments.
He speaks contemptuously of the art of his time, and yet
he gives some curious hints that are well worth collecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
for experiment. His fragmentary information, though
often inaccurate, is most valuable to those who are
seeking once more to find lasting colours, and despair of
discovering mordants that will fix the aniline tints. From
him we learn more of the Egyptian colouring materials
than of any others, as he named their sources, European,
Asiatic, or African; and there is no doubt of the perfection
of their mural pigments and textile dyes, which have
remained unimpaired to the present time.</p>

<p>Renouf says that &ldquo;painting, as it is now understood,
was totally unknown to the Egyptians; but they understood
harmony of colour,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> and formulated in it certain
principles for decorative uses. They made the primary
colours predominate over the secondary by quantity and
position. They introduced fillets of white or yellow in their
embroideries, as well as in their paintings, between reds
and greens, to isolate them; and they balanced masses of
yellow with a due proportion of black.&rdquo; They never
blended their colours, and had no sense of the harmony
of prismatic gradations, or the melting of one tint into
another; each was worked up to a hard and fast edge
line. If in one part of a building, one set of colours predominated,
they placed a greater proportion of other colours
elsewhere, within the range of sight, so as to readjust the
balance. Those they employed were mostly earthy mineral
colours (used alike for frescoes and for painting cotton
cloths, though vegetable dyes were needed for woollens
and linens). These were: for <em>white</em>, pure chalk; for
<em>black</em>, bone-black mixed with gum; for <em>yellow</em>, yellow
ochre; for <em>green</em>, a mixture of yellow ochre and powdered
blue glass; for <em>blue</em>, this same blue glass mixed with white
chalk; for <em>red</em>, an earthy pigment containing iron and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
aluminium.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> They understood the chemistry of bleaching,
and the use of mordants in dyeing.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>The statistical records of China of the time of Hias
(2205 <small>B.C.</small>), according to Semper, mention colours as
being of five tints, and all the produce of the Chinese
Empire.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>In the unchanging art of India, the ancient colours
are used now. Therefore, when we give the following
list, we must suppose that it embraces all that have been
known from the beginning.</p>

<p>Indian dyes are mostly vegetable. For <em>yellow</em>, akalbir,
the root of the Datiscus Canabinus; also yellow is dyed with
asbarg, the flower of the Cabul larkspur (<i>Delphinium sp.</i>).</p>

<p><em>Orange.</em> Soneri dyed with narsingar, the honey-scented
flower of nyclanthes (<i>Arbor Tristis</i>).</p>

<p><em>Scarlet</em> is first dyed with cochineal (formerly with
kermes), which gives a crimson colour; next with
narsingar, which turns it vermilion.</p>

<p><em>Purple</em> is dyed first with cochineal (formerly kermes),
afterwards with indigo.</p>

<p><em>Lilac.</em> Ditto, only paler.</p>

<p><em>Blue.</em> All shades of indigo.</p>

<p><em>Green.</em> With indigo first, and next the various yellow
dyes.</p>

<p><em>Brown.</em> Sandal-wood, called &ldquo;sandali;&rdquo; almond colour
(Badami).</p>

<p><em>Grey.</em> Sulphate of iron and gold.</p>

<p><em>Black.</em> Deepest shade of indigo.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of Indian coloured textiles, Sir G. Birdwood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
says: &ldquo;All violent contrasts are avoided. The richest
colours are used, but are so arranged as to produce the
effect of a neutral bloom, which tones down every detail
almost to the softness and transparency of the atmosphere.&rdquo;
He says that in their apparel both the colouring and
the ornaments are adapted to the effect which the fabrics
will produce when worn and in motion. &ldquo;It is only
through generations of patient practice that men attain
to the mystery of such subtleties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An outline, in black or some dark colour that harmonizes
with the ground, or else worked in gold, is common
in Indian work, not only for the purpose of isolating
the colours of the design, but also to give a uniform
tone to the whole surface of the texture. Their traditional
arrangements of tints were thoroughly satisfying
to the eye. But degenerated by European commerce,
the artistic sense of beauty itself is disappearing throughout
our Indian Empire.</p>

<p>Persian carpets (the fine old ones of the fourteenth to
the seventeenth centuries) give us lessons in the art of
isolating colours. In these, a flower will lie upon a
surface which contains two or more other tints, and as
the design passes over them, the outline colour is
changed, so as to isolate the flower equally on the
different grounds. This is done with such art that the
eye ignores the transition till it is called to remark it.
For instance, as a white, or no-coloured pattern, wanders
over a green and red ground, the outline changes suddenly
from green to red, and again to green as it
leaves the opposite colour on the ground pattern.</p>

<p>Mr. Floyer speaks of the brilliancy and lasting qualities
of the dyes which the Persians, by slow and tedious
processes, extract from plants; from the &ldquo;runaschk&rdquo;
(madder), a fine red; from the &ldquo;zarili&rdquo; (the golden), which
is a yellow flower from Khorasan, and also from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
leaves of the vine, a bright yellow.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> They import indigo
from Shastra (or from India), by the Khurum river. He
says these dyes are perfectly fast, leaving no trace on
a wetted rubber, whereas the European dyes they sometimes
use come off freely.</p>

<p>Pliny says the Gauls had invented dyes counterfeiting
the purple of Tyre; also scarlet, violet, and green, all of
these were dipped in the juices of herbs.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Vitruvius says the Romans extracted dyes from flowers
and fruits, but he neither specifies nor describes them.</p>

<p>The ancient Highland tartans were dyed with bark of
alder for black, bark of willow for flesh colour. A lichen
growing on stones supplied their violets and crimson.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
The lichen on the birch-tree gives a good brown; heather
gives red, purple, and green.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>Thus we see that pure colours for dyeing textiles have
been extracted from vegetable substances&mdash;herbs, wood,
seeds, flowers and fruits, mosses and sea-weeds;<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> mineral
substances&mdash;earths, sands, ores, metals, rusts, and stones;
animal substances&mdash;both of land, water, and air; beasts,
fishes, shells, birds, and insects.</p>

<p>It is evident, from the derivation of the word, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
there were chromatic scales in colour before the phrase
was ever applied to music.</p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans are supposed to have understood
chromatic scales of tints&mdash;animal, vegetable, and
mineral&mdash;and except with the intention of producing
startling effects, they did not mix them. They felt that
each was harmonious as a whole, and, unlike the
Egyptians, they studied harmony. They arranged
their scales according to the materials from which they
were extracted, and kept those from different chemical
sources apart, as being discordant.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> One scale was that
of the iodine colours, of and from the sea. Marine products
are mostly iridescent. To comprehend this, think
of the harmonious interchange of delicate tints, called
by the ancients &ldquo;purple,&rdquo; on a string of pearls. Shells
and shell-fish, sea-weeds and fish, furnished these dyes.
They were called &ldquo;conchiliata.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chemistry of the arts of bleaching was not
unknown to the ancients; but they reserved and regulated
it for certain purposes, preferring to retain at least a
part of the original colouring, as shades of grounding
which served, as a surface glaze does in painting, to
connect and harmonize the superinduced tints.</p>

<p>Experiments with the object of reviving this mode of
producing harmonious combinations, have been made
lately at the Wilton Carpet Works, by dyeing shades of
colour on unbleached goat&rsquo;s and camel&rsquo;s hair, and sheep&rsquo;s
wool; and the tones produced are beautifully soft and rich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
M. Edouard Charton ascribes the great change in the
modern scales of colours to the discovery by the French,
in the Gobelins, of a pure scarlet dye, the use of which
made it necessary to raise the tone of all other colours.
He says that scarlet was formerly represented by the dye
called kermes, which indeed was not scarlet, but altered
from crimson to something approaching it by the
addition of narsingar, of which the bright yellow gave
the scarlet effect.</p>

<p>M. Chevreul, director of the dyeing department of the
Gobelins, has succeeded in composing the chromatic
prism, to which I have already alluded, containing
4420 different tones. We may take it for granted, that
from these may be selected any possible scale of tints
required for decorative work. This vast area for
choice of our material will impose on the artist of the
future fresh responsibilities.</p>

<p>In the typical Oriental colouring, the whole arrangement
was traditional, and it was irreligious to depart
from what had been fixed by statute many centuries
before, and only perfected by the experience of many
generations of men; and this veneration for traditional
custom has hitherto been prevalent in European art to a
certain point. But the old conservative perfection of unadulterated
colour has already been done away with. The
freedom of experimental art is chartered, and mercantile
interests now, as ever, govern the supply of materials.</p>

<p>Our normal bad taste and carelessness has been cast
back on the lands which were the cradle of art, and we
receive, to our surprise, gaudy, vulgar, and discordant
combinations from the East, whence we drew our first
inspirations. For the future we shall have to study
ancient specimens, and correct our errors by the help
of their teaching to the eye and mind.</p>

<p>Gas colours are at present our worst snares. They are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
in general very beautiful; but they are so evanescent, and
fade into such unexpected and contradictory tones, that
we cannot reckon upon them. When embroidering with
the coloured materials of the day, we are in constant
dread of what disastrous effect may be produced by the
first shaft of sunshine that may fall from our moderately
illuminated sky, through the uncurtained window.</p>

<p>The trade in colours can hardly be an honest one, till
the means of fixing each tint permanently is ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
At any rate, something should be done towards grouping
them, with respect to their enduring qualities, so
that when they fade, if fade they must, they may do so
harmoniously, and in sympathy with each other; and
while they are in their first glow they should be selected,
as much as possible, from what Pliny calls natural colours,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
which recall the exquisite effects of nature, searched out
and displayed by every sunny gleam, reflected on each
other in lovely tones, and subdued and veiled by passing
shadows. It is said that Mr. Wardle, of Leek, is now
seeking for dyes of pure unadulterated colours, and
mordants to fix them. He deserves all success.</p>

<p>The reason I have entered, in even so cursory a
manner, into the history of colours is my desire to point
out the great value placed, long ago, on the careful
preparation of those used in ancient textile art; and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
show how our forefathers sought them out in many lands
and waters; how they noted their varieties; how they
classed and prized them for their endurance as well as for
their pristine beauty; how they paid their weight in gold
or silver for certain culminating tints; and how they,
therefore, produced works which became matters of
history and landmarks in civilization.</p>

The effect of colour on the brain is a subject only just now
beginning to attract attention. Experiments on the insane have been

with blue glass alternating with white have sensibly calmed the nerves
of the patients.</p>

&ldquo;Purpura&rdquo; is supposed to mean crimson velvet. It came, like
&ldquo;cramoisi,&rdquo; to be a name for a tissue. Fr. Michell quotes velvet of
Vermeil-cramoisi, &ldquo;violet and blue cramoisi, and pourpre of divers
colours,&rdquo; but he says he never met with &ldquo;pourpre blanche.&rdquo; Yule, ed.
1875, i. p. 67. Plano Carpini (p. 755) says the courtiers of Karakorum were
clad in &ldquo;white purpura;&rdquo; and that on the first day of the great festival
in honour of the inauguration of Kuyuk Khan, all the Mogul nobles
were clad in pourpre blanche, the second day in ruby purple, and the
third in blue purple: on the fourth day they appeared in Baudichin (cloth
of gold). (Yule, &ldquo;Marco Polo,&rdquo; vol. i. p. 376.) White purple is also
named in the inventories of Sta. Maria Maggiore at Rome, and those of
Notre Dame in Paris. &ldquo;Histoire du Tissu Ancien, &agrave; l&rsquo;Exposition de

Fran&ccedil;ois Le Normant, in his &ldquo;Grande Gr&egrave;ce,&rdquo; tells of the dye of
the purple of Tarentum from the murex, found in the Mare Piccolo.
He says that Tarentine muslins, woven from the filaments of the
pinna dipped in the dye of the murex, rivalled those of Cos. Le
Normant laments the total neglect of the murex in these days (could
its trade be revived?) Plutarch says that Alexander the Great,
having made himself master of Susa (Shushan), found, amongst other
riches of marvellous value, &ldquo;purple of Hermione&rdquo; worth forty thousand
talents (Quintus Curtius says fifty thousand), which, though it had
been stored 190 years, retained all its freshness and beauty. See
Plutarch&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lives,&rdquo; edited by J. and W. Langhorne, vol. ii. p. 739;
Bl&uuml;mner, i. p. 224-240. The reason assigned for their dye being so
perfect was that the Susanians knew how to comb the wool to be
dipped, and prepare it with honey. According to Aristotle the dress
of Alcisthenes, the Sybarite, was dyed with this purple from Shushan
(Ciampini, Vet. Mon.).</p>

Semper gives us an account of iodine colours. Some, he says, were
extracted from sea-weeds, green and yellow; the purples, when finest,
from the shell-fish. The Ph&oelig;nician coasts gave the best purples; those
of the Atlantic the best blacks and browns. And thus he completes
the scale of iodine colours. See Semper, &ldquo;Der Stil,&rdquo; i. p. 206.</p>

Heaps of the shells of this &ldquo;murex trunculus&rdquo; have been found at
Pompeii, near the dyers&rsquo; works. Hardouin says that in his time they
were found at Otranto, and similar remains have been noticed at Sidon.
Sir James Lacaita informs me that the living shells are still found
along the shores of the Adriatic, as well as on the wash near Argos.
No doubt the Ph&oelig;nicians traded first in the produce of the Sidonian
and Tyrian coasts, though they afterwards went farther afield in collecting
their dyes. Auberville says that the purple of the Romans
was a deep violet (double dyed, purpur&aelig; dibaph&aelig;), and that this
colour was Asiatic. The Ph&oelig;nicians traded in it, and sold it for its
weight in silver. Instead of fading in the sunshine, its colour intensified.
The enduring nature of this colour is proved by the purple
fragments from a Greek tomb in the Crimea of about 300 <small>B.C.</small>, described
in chapter on <a href="#Page_194">stitches</a>, p. <a href="#Page_217">217</a>. See &ldquo;Histoire du Tissu Ancien, &agrave; l&rsquo;Exposition

Though really red of the purest colour, it doubtless received its
name of Tyrian purple as being one of the materials of the amethystine
double dye. The web or fleece was first dipped in the dye of Purpura,
and then in that of the Buccinum, or they reversed the process to give
a different tint. This is Pliny&rsquo;s account of the process of dyeing,
which is very simple, and gives no details. Semper says that the
ancients called black and white the two extremes of purple&mdash;white
the thinnest, and black the thickest or most solid layer of colour.
Both were thus considered as colour. (Semper, i. pp. 205-7.) As long
as there is light, black always appears to be either blue, or brown, or
green, till with darkness all colour disappears.</p>

The Cretan tincture was extracted from a plant which Theophrastus,

The same scale of colour varies as much on the different textiles
employed, as it does from the colours extracted from other chemicals.
Silk, wool, cotton, flax, give very different results. The colouring
matter may be identical, yet you cannot place them side by side without
being aware that they may be repellant, instead of harmonious in tone.
The scale is sometimes removed to another pitch, and they will no
more harmonize than instruments that have not been attuned to the
same diapason. See Redgrave&rsquo;s Report on Textile Fabrics.</p>

With the changes in colouring materials has arisen the necessity
for discovering new mordants. The gas colour of madder is exactly

hue.</p>

of 45 per cent. on entering the country, and at a certain distance
within the frontier, they are confiscated and destroyed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<h3><i>Part 1.</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Stitches.</span></h4>

<p>Stitches in needlework correspond to the touches of the
pencil or brush in drawing or painting, or to the strokes of
the chisel in sculpture. The needle is the one implement
of the craft by which endless forms of surface-work are
executed. With a thread through its one eye, it blindly
follows each effort of its pointed foot, urged by the
intelligent or mechanical hand grouping the stitches,
which, being long or short, single or mixed, slanting,
upright, or crossed, are selected as the best fitted for the
design and purpose in hand. The word &ldquo;stitches&rdquo; does
not, however, in this chapter represent merely the plural of
one particular process of needle insertion, but the produce
and effect of each different kind of stitch by grouping
and repetition, according to its most ancient nomenclature.
That which is astonishing is the endless variety of surface,
of design, of hints and suggestions, of startling effects, and
of lovely combinations, resulting from the direction of the
needle and manipulation of the materials, and differing
from each other according to the power or the caprice
of the worker. But the machine is always the same&mdash;the
threaded needle strikes the same interval, forming
the &ldquo;stitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This venerable implement, <em>the needle</em>, has, through the
ages, varied but little in form. The attenuated body,
the sharp foot, the rounded head, and the eye to hold
the thread, are the same in principle, whether it is found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
in the cave-man&rsquo;s grave, formed of a fish&rsquo;s bone or
shaped from that of a larger animal; hammered of
the finest bronze, as from Egypt, or of gold, like those
found in Scandinavia. A bronze needle was lately discovered
in the tomb of a woman of the Vikings in
Scotland, and its value is shown by its being placed in a
silver case. Steel needles were first made in England
in 1545, by a native of India. His successor, Christopher
Greening, established a workshop in 1560 at Long
Crendon, in Bucks, which existed there as a needle
factory till quite lately. The rustic poetic drama, entitled
&ldquo;Gammer Gurton&rsquo;s Needle,&rdquo; performed at Ch. Coll.,
Cambridge, in 1566, was a regular comedy, of which a
lost needle was the hero. In those days the village
needle was evidently still a rare and precious possession.</p>

<p>The art of embroidery consists of a design, which
includes the pattern, and the handicraft or stitches&mdash;the
&ldquo;motive&rdquo; and the &ldquo;needlework.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In painting, as in sculpture, the first idea, as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
the last touch, must come from the same head and hand.
But in needlework it is not so. The pattern is the result
of tradition. It is almost always simply a variation of
old forms, altered and renewed by surrounding circumstances
and sudden or gradual periods of change.</p>

<p>However much the design may alter, rising often to
the highest point of decorative art, and as often falling
back to the lowest and most meaningless repetitions and
imitations, the <em>stitches</em> themselves vary but little. The
same are to be found in Egyptian and Greek specimens,
and the classical names are those used by medi&aelig;val
writers, and have come down to us, &ldquo;floating like bubbles
on the waves of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir George Birdwood<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> thinks that every kind of
stitch is found in traditional Indian work. I confess
that I have not been able hitherto to trace any of the
&ldquo;mosaic&rdquo; stitches to India, nor do we ever see them in
Chinese or Japanese embroidery, which shows every
other variety. They are, however, occasionally found in
Egyptian work.</p>

<h3><i>Part 2.</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Plain Work and White Work.</span></h4>

<p>We are told that the primal man and woman sewed in
Paradise.</p>

<p>To &ldquo;sew,&rdquo; in contradistinction to the word to
&ldquo;embroider,&rdquo; is derived from the Sanskrit <i>su</i>, <i>suchi</i>, and
thence imported into Latin, <i>suo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> To prove how highly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
esteemed needlework was among the Romans, I may
mention that the equivalent of the phrase &ldquo;to hit the
right nail on the head&rdquo; was <i>rem acu tangere</i>, &ldquo;to
touch the question with the point of the needle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plain work&rdquo; is that which is necessary. As soon
as textiles are needed for covering and clothing, the
means are invented for drawing the cut edges together,
and for preventing the fraying where the material
is lacerated by the shaping process. Hence the
&ldquo;seam,&rdquo; the &ldquo;hem,&rdquo; and all the forms of stitches that
bind and plait. These necessary stitches constitute
plain needlework, and are closely followed by decorative
stitches, which in gradation cover the space between
plain needlework and embroidery.</p>

<p>Semper has given us his arch&aelig;ological theories for the
origin of needlework and its stitches.</p>

<p>These are his arguments, if not always his words. He
says: &ldquo;The seam is one of the first human successful
efforts to conquer difficulties.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>A string, a ribbon, a band, may serve to keep together
several loose things; but by means of the seam, small things
actually become large ones. For example: a full-grown
man can, by its help, cover himself with a garment made
of the skins of many small animals. When Eve sewed
fig-leaves together, she made of these small pieces a
garment of patchwork.</p>

<p>Acting on the principle of making a virtue of necessity,
accepting and adorning the severe facts of life, seams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
came to be an important vehicle of ornament. The
Gauls and Britons embroidered the seams of their
fur garments. &ldquo;We may judge of the antiquity of the
seam by its universal and mythological meaning. The
seam, the tie, the knot, the plait, and the mesh are the
earliest symbols of fate uniting events.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>We find but little mention of plain work in medi&aelig;val
writings. When linen was worked for some honourable
purpose, such as a gift to a friend or a royal personage,
it was generally embroidered or stitched in some fancy
fashion. Queen Elizabeth presented Edward VI., on his
second birthday, with a smock made by herself. Fine
linen was about this time constantly edged with bone laces.</p>

<p>Mrs. Floyer has written so well, and given us so
much practical information on plain needlework, that I
feel it unnecessary to enter at any length into the
principles of plain sewing, as my theme is needlework as
decorative art.</p>

<p>Mrs. Floyer has, as it were, unpicked and unravelled
every stitch in plain work, till she has discovered and
laid bare its intention, its construction, and effect. She,
has also given us rules made clear to the dullest understanding,
instructing us how to teach the young and
ignorant. She shows us the quickest and most perfect
way of working different materials for different purposes,
and tells us how to select them. I will, therefore, refer
my readers to her most useful and instructive books,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> and
pass on at once from the craft of plain needlework, to
stitches as the art of embroidery.</p>

<p>The link between plain and decorative work deserves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
attention. This link is &ldquo;white embroidery.&rdquo; I imagine
it was not a very ancient form of the art, and was practised
first in medi&aelig;val days; when we begin to have constant
notices of it. The first white laces appear to have
followed close upon the first white embroideries.</p>

<p>There is a tomb of the fourteenth century in the Church
of the Ara C&oelig;li at Rome, where the effigy of a knight lies
on his bed, draped with a sheet and a coverlet, both
embroidered. These are evidently of linen worked in
white.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> I give a drawing of them in illustration (pl. <a href="#pl39">39</a>).</p>

<p>From that date we find continually mention of such
work by nuns and ladies.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> In England it was especially
called &ldquo;nuns&rsquo; work&rdquo; (plate <a href="#pl42">42</a>). There is a great survival
of this stitchery in Italy amongst the peasantry. They
have always adorned their smocks and aprons, and their
linen head-coverings, and the borders of sheets for great
occasions, with patterns in &ldquo;flat stitches,&rdquo; &ldquo;cut stitches,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;drawn work.&rdquo; The Greek peasants do the same.
In Germany will be found much curious white embroidery,
of designs which show their antiquity; and from Spain
we get &ldquo;Spanish work&rdquo; in black, on white linen, which
is nearly allied to the stitches of white work.</p>

of the purest Hispano-Moorish design, and unrivalled in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
beauty. It is embroidered in Spanish stitches in white
thread, on the finest linen, and is intersected with fine lace
insertion (pl. <a href="#pl40">40</a>). It is said to have been found in the
time of Elizabeth with some other articles in a dry well;
among them a little satin shoe, of which the shape
proves its date to be of the end of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s
reign. Russian embroidery, consisting of geometrical
patterns in red, blue, and black thread, is of this class.</p>

<p>In England alone, the peasantry do no white work for
home use, and we must suppose it has never been a
domestic occupation. Indeed, the love of the needle is
by no means an English national tendency, in the lower
classes. Nothing but the plainest work is taught in our
schools. Anything approaching to decorative art, with
us, has been the accomplishment of educated women, and
not the employment of leisure moments in the houses of
the poor.</p>

<p>Semper, in &ldquo;Der Stil,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> gives rules for white embroidery,
and the reasons from which he deduces them
are good. He says, that allowing it as a maxim that
each textile has its own uses and its own beauties, we
should place nothing on linen which would militate against
its inherent qualities and merits; and that, as the great
beauty of flax is its smoothness and purity, all projections
and roughnesses should be avoided which would catch
dust or throw a shadow. Carrying out this idea, it would
appear that satin, and not lace stitches are therefore, the
most suitable for this kind of decoration. The accepted
rule for selecting the stitch for each piece of work is
this: on stout grounds the thread should be round and
rich, whereas delicate materials carry best the most
refined and shining thread work; and in embroidering the
smooth surface of linen fabrics, the flattest stitches are the
most appropriate.</p>

<h3><i>Part 3.</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Opus Phrygium</span> (<i>or gold work</i>).</h4>

<p>Gold embroideries were by the Romans attributed to
the Phrygians. All gold work was vaguely supposed to
be theirs, as all other embroidery was included in the
craft of the Plumarii in Rome.</p>

<p>It has been disputed whether needlework in gold
preceded the weaving of flat gold or thread into
stuffs, or whether it was an after-thought, and an enrichment
of such textiles. I imagine that the embroidery
was the first, and that the after-thought was the art of
weaving gold. Babylonian embroideries appear to be
of gold wire, as we see them in the Ninevite marbles.</p>

<p>An instance of the way golden embroideries were
displayed among the Greeks is that of the Athenian
peplos, which, as I have already said (p. 32), was worked
by embroideresses under the superintendence of two
Arrhephor&aelig; of noble birth. It was either scarlet or
saffron colour, and blazed with golden representations of
the battles of the giants, or local myths and events in the
history of Athens.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>The art of the Phrygians, who gave their name in
Rome to all golden thread-work, has come down to us
through the classic &ldquo;auriphrygium&rdquo; and the &ldquo;orphreys&rdquo;
of the Middle Ages. Semper thinks that the flat gold
embroidery was the first invented.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>The Phrygians had attained to the utmost perfection
in tissue ornament when the Romans conquered them,
and finding their art congenial to the growing luxury of
Rome, they imported and domesticated it; both the
people and their work retaining their national designation.
Pliny, ignorant of the claims of the Chinese, gave to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
the Phrygians the credit of being the inventors of all embroidery.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
The garments they thus decorated were called
&ldquo;phrygion&aelig;,&rdquo; and the work itself &ldquo;opus Phrygium.&rdquo;
The term &ldquo;auriphrygium,&rdquo; at first given to work in
gold only, was in time applied to all embroidery that
admitted gold into its composition; and hence the
English medi&aelig;val term, &ldquo;orphreys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the gold stitches now called &ldquo;passing&rdquo; came
from Phrygia; Semper attributes all the &ldquo;mosaic
stitches&rdquo; to the Phrygians, calling them &ldquo;opus Phrygionium.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
Gold stitches are splendidly exemplified in the
embroidered mantle of St. Stephen, of the ninth century.
The only somewhat earlier piece of medi&aelig;val gold
embroidery with which I am acquainted is the dalmatic
of Charlemagne in the Vatican, richly embroidered in fine
gold thread; and the mantle of the Emperor Henry II.
in the Museum at Munich, worked by his Empress
Kunigunda, who appears to have been somewhat parsimonious
in her use of the precious material.</p>

<p>Almost all ecclesiastical and royal ancient embroideries
were illuminated with golden grounds&mdash;golden outlines or
golden flat embroideries. Later still, raised gold thread
work has imitated gilt carvings or goldsmiths&rsquo; jewellery;
and we feel that it was at once removed from its place as
embroidery, and became an elaborate imitation of what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
should belong to another craft.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Such deviations from
the proper office and motive of needlework are so
dangerously near to bad style and bad taste, that they
always and inevitably have fallen into disrepute.</p>


<h3><i>Part 4.</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Opus Pulvinarium</span> (<i>or cushion work</i>).</h4>

<p>This &ldquo;opus pulvinarium&rdquo; is not only to be found in
Oriental work, but it has also survived in a very few
fragments from Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> One of these, in the British
Museum, is worked on canvas, in wool and flax; another
in a white shining thread, resembling asbestos, on linen
or fine canvas. They are regular &ldquo;canvas&rdquo; or &ldquo;cross&rdquo;
stitches, and therefore, under medi&aelig;val nomenclature,
would be classed as &ldquo;opus pulvinarium.&rdquo; This name
must include all stitches in gold, silk, and wool, whether
Phrygian, Egyptian, or Babylonian in their origin,
excepting the flat and lace stitches (plate <a href="#pl41">41</a>).</p>

<p class="topcapt smcap">Mosaic Stitches.</p>

<p class="caphang">1. Italian Pattern, sixteenth century. From Frida Lipperheide&rsquo;s Musterbuch. 2. Scandinavian.
Bock, i. taf. xi. 3. Egyptian. From Auberville&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tissus,&rdquo; p. 1.</p>

<p>Semper&rsquo;s term, &ldquo;mosaic&rdquo; stitches, is a good one, as it
covers all that are relegated into patterns in small square
spaces, counted by the threads of the textile on which
they are laid.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> He believes that the mosaic patterns and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
cross stitches in needlework preceded the tesselated
pavements, and formed their first motive, though the
stitch now refers itself back to the mosaic, at least in
name.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that in Chaldea and Assyria there
still exist some ruined walls, which are adorned with
pilasters, panels, and other architectural forms, covered
with some sort of encaustic, imitating textile patterns.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
The effect is produced by means of a kind of mosaic
work of small nails or wedges of baked clay, with china
or glazed coloured heads. These are inlaid into the
unbaked clay or earth, of which the walls are constructed,
and while binding it together, give the effect of the
surface being hung with a material which has a pattern
worked all over in cross stitch.</p>

<p>The Chinese, the Chaldeans, and the Assyrians long
continued to show in their buildings the tradition of this
style of decoration. In Egypt there has been found
some unfinished mural painting where the plaster has
been previously prepared by dividing it into small
rectangular spaces, apparently on the principle of the
canvas ground for cross stitches.</p>

<p>The name &ldquo;mosaic&rdquo; stitch does not interfere with,
or militate against the classical appellation of <i>opus
pulvinarium</i>, which means &ldquo;shrine work&rdquo; or &ldquo;cushion
stitches.&rdquo; These appear to have been from the first
considered as the best suited for adorning cushions,
chairs, footstools, and the beds on which men reclined at
their feasts, as they are firmly-set stitches which will
stand friction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
Most of the work now done in Syria, Turkey, Greece,
and the Principalities, shows different forms of the mosaic
stitches; so also does the national Russian work, which
is Byzantine. All these designs are conventional and
mostly geometrical.</p>

<p>This work, in the East, is generally the same on both
sides. We may infer that the spoil anticipated by Sisera&rsquo;s
mother, &ldquo;the garments embroidered on both sides, fit
for the necks of those who divide the spoil,&rdquo; was of this
kind.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the &ldquo;opus pulvinarium&rdquo; has a very
respectable ancestry; and though it had somewhat
degenerated in the early part of our century, and had
languished and almost died out under the name of Berlin
wool work, yet it has done good service through the days
of medi&aelig;val art down to the present time, both in England
and throughout Europe (pl. <a href="#pl42">42</a>); and it will probably
revive and continue to be generally used.</p>

<p>Though the least available for historical or pictorial
work, and not by any means the best for flower-pieces (as
the squareness of the stitches refuses to lend itself to
flowing lines or gradations of colour, unless the stitches
are extremely fine, and the work, in consequence, very
laborious), yet it finds its especial fitness in all geometrical
designs. It is also particularly well suited to heraldic
subjects.</p>

<p>A remarkable example of the use of cross stitches
exists in the borders of the Syon cope, in which the
coats-of-arms are so executed. This is of the thirteenth
century; and besides these cushion stitches, it exhibits all
those which are grouped in the style called opus Anglicum

<p>Many charming designs for this kind of stitch may be
found in the old German pattern-books of the Renaissance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
(Spitzen Musterb&uuml;cher), and also in those Venetian
&ldquo;Corone di Vertuose Donne&rdquo; lately reprinted by the
Venetian publisher Organia. These are worthy of a
place in every library of art.</p>

<p>It would seem best to place the chain stitch named
&ldquo;tambour&rdquo; in this class, as it naturally assimilates with
the plaited and cross stitches. It is so called from the
drum-shaped frame of the last century in which it was
usually worked.</p>


<h3><i>Part 5.</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Opus Plumarium</span> (<i>or plumage work</i>).</h4>

<p>The &ldquo;Opus Plumarium&rdquo; is one of the most ancient
groups, and includes all flat stitches, of which the distinguishing
mark is, that they <em>pass</em> each other, overlap,
and blend together. &ldquo;Stem,&rdquo; &ldquo;twist,&rdquo; &ldquo;Japanese stitch,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;long and short&rdquo; or &ldquo;embroidery stitch,&rdquo; belong to
this class, to which I propose to restore its original title
of plumage work.</p>

<p>The origin of the name is much disputed, but it is
supposed to have pointed to a decoration of plumage
work, and we find that feathers have been an element in
artistic design from the earliest times. There were
patterns in Egyptian painting which certainly had feathers
for their motive (fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>, p. <a href="#Page_208">208</a>).</p>

<p>Semper, finding that birds&rsquo;-skins were a recognized
article for trade in China, 2205 <small>B.C.</small>,<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> believes that they
were used as onlaid application for architectural decoration;
and this is possible, for we still obtain from thence
specimens of work in different materials partly onlaid in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
whole feathers, whereas sometimes the longer threads of
the feathers are woven
by the needle into the
ground web. In Her
Majesty&rsquo;s collection there
are some specimens from
Burmah&mdash;creatures resembling
sphinxes or
deformed cherubim, executed
in feathers, applied
on silk and outlined in
gold. We have likewise
from Burmah, in the Indian
Museum, two peacocks<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
similarly worked;
the legs and beaks are
solidly raised in gold
thread; and the outlines also are raised in gold, giving
the appearance of enamelling. The <i>cloisonn&eacute;</i> effect of
brilliant colours, contrasted and enhanced by the separation
of the gold outlines, can be seen to perfection in
specimens of the beautiful Pekin jewellers&rsquo; work, where
the feathers are inlaid in gold ornaments for the head
and in the handles of fans. Nothing but gems can be
more resplendent.</p>

<p>These survivals help us to understand the casual
mention we find in classical authors, of the works of the
Plumarii, which appellation was given at last to all
embroiderers who were not Phrygians.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>

different parts of India.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>The use of feathers is common in the islands of the
Pacific. It is native to the Sandwich islanders; and
M. Jules Remy describes the Hawaiian royal mantle,
which was being constructed of yellow birds&rsquo; feathers
through seven consecutive reigns, and was valued in
Hawaii at 5,000,000 francs. A mantle of this description
is the property of Lady Brassey.</p>

<p>In Africa, ancient Egyptian art furnishes us with traditional
feather patterns and head-dresses; and Pigafetta
tells us of costumes of birds&rsquo; skins, worn in the
kingdom of Congo in the sixteenth century for their
warmth; sea-birds&rsquo; feathers being highly esteemed.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>In America, where birds are most splendid, the art of
the feather worker was carried to the greatest perfection.
It was found there by the Spaniards, and recorded in all
their writings for its beauty of design and execution, and
for its great value, equal to that of gold and precious
stones.</p>

<p>Though now looked down upon, as being a semi-barbarous
style of decoration, because it exists no longer
except in semi-barbarous countries, we must consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
feather work as a relic of a past higher civilization which
has died out, rather than simply as the effort of the
savage to deck himself in the brightest colours attainable.</p>

<p>Feather-work is a lost art, but the name of &ldquo;opus
plumarium&rdquo; remains, and proves that it was still recognized
as such in the days of Roman luxury. The name
survived when the practice was all but forgotten in
Europe,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> and the art itself disused, probably, because
the birds of our continent rarely have any lovely plumage
to tempt the eye.</p>

<p>But the glory of feather-work was found again in
Mexico and Peru, and the surrounding nations, in the sixteenth
century&mdash;praised, exalted, demoralized, and crushed
out by the cruelties of conquest. The Spaniards at first
brought home beautiful garments and hangings, representing
gods and heroes, all worked in feathers.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Under their
rule the natives produced pictures agreeable to the taste
of their masters. Pope Sixtus V. accepted a head of St.
Francis, which had been executed by one of the ablest
of the &ldquo;amantecas&rdquo; (the name for an artist in feathers).
Sixtus was struck with surprise and admiration at the
beauty and artistic cleverness of the work, and, until he
had touched and examined it closely, would not believe
that plumage was the only material used.</p>

<p>There are beautiful hangings and bed furniture at
Moritzburg, near Dresden, said to have belonged to
Montezuma. They were given to Augustus the Strong,
King of Poland, by a king of Spain.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, and later, feather work
was still an art in Mexico, the convents continuing to
preserve its traditions. Bustamente says that this industry
was still in operation in the beginning of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
century. The Mexican Museum preserves specimens of
the last three hundred years, from the time of the conquest
of Mexico.</p>

<p>There is in the Cluny Museum, in Paris, a beautiful
triptych, evidently of the sixteenth century. It is worked
in feathers, with delicate outlines in fine gold thread.
Nothing can exceed the tenderness and harmony of the
colouring in shades of blue, and warm and cool brown tints.
This is probably a survival of that lost art of Mexico
which was carried on in their convents, and may have
been a copy of a treasured relic of European art.</p>

<p>Among the few noteworthy specimens that have
survived, is the mitre of St. Carlo Borromeo at Milan,
described by M. F. Denis as being both artistic and
beautiful. He tells us in his Appendix that even now,
a tissue of feathers is woven in France, as soft and
flexible as a silk damask; and rivalling the Mexican
scarlet feather fabric, which the Spaniards admired so
greatly. He also speaks of the inlaid feather work, invented
by M. Le Normant of Rouen, in the last century,
and afterwards continued in Paris by his English pupil,
Mr. Levet, who sold two of his works to the then Duke
of Leeds, in 1735. The first is a vase of flowers, the
second a peacock, designed by M. Oudry (peintre du
Roi). Both of these, framed as screens, are now at
Hornby Castle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately feathers are, by their nature, most
attractive to that greatest destroyer, next to Attila&mdash;the
moth. Ghirlandajo called mosaic in marble and glass,
&ldquo;painting for eternity;&rdquo; we may call feather work,
&ldquo;painting for a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the essays of M. Ferdinand Denis,<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> much may
be learned of the <i>arte plumaria</i> of the Mexicans and
their neighbours of Brazil, Guatemala, Peru, and Yucatan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
and the land of the Zapotecas, &amp;c., where it was also
cultivated. He says that their civilization is so mysterious
that we have as yet no means of judging whence
came their art.</p>

<p>Fergusson suggests the similarity between Central
Asian and Central American art, both in architectural
forms and plastic and sculptured remains. He thinks that
its tradition was transmitted from Asia to America in the
third and fourth centuries of our era. If so, it was an
unlucky moment for the recipients, as the art of Asia, as
well as that of Europe, was then at its lowest and most
debased phase; perhaps, however, the more fit for the
fertilization of that of a perfectly barbarous people. There
is something fascinating in the suggestions on this subject
in Mr. Donelly&rsquo;s &ldquo;Atlantis;&rdquo; but when conjecture is
only founded on tradition, and without proof, we must
not take it into serious consideration.</p>

<p>Having proved the universal use of feathers, it is not
difficult to appreciate the causes which suggested everywhere
the transfer of this decorative art to another
craft, employing less perishable materials. Embroidery
probably followed it closely and absorbed it throughout
Asia and in Egypt; and the survivals now are only an
accidental specimen, a tradition, and a name.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>The name &ldquo;Plumarii,&rdquo; for the embroideries, is thus fully
accounted for, and we need seek no further elucidation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
It was commonly used in classical Roman times. &ldquo;Opus
plumarium&rdquo; seems to have become the legitimate term
for all needlework. The Plumarii were the embroiderers,
whether their work was in wool, or thread, or in silk (at
a later period),<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> with or without admixture of gold or
silver (as the Argentarii were the jewellers).</p>

<p>The article on the word &ldquo;plumarius&rdquo; in Hoffman&rsquo;s
Lexicon,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> after describing two kinds of Plumarii,
Phrygians and Babylonians, proceeds to say, &ldquo;These
latter, who wove garments and hangings of various
colours, were called &lsquo;Plumarii;&rsquo; but though this name
was at first confined to craftsmen who wove patterns
in the shape of feathers, in course of time the name
was extended to those artists who, with the needle or by
painting, embellished robes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>The &ldquo;opus plumarium&rdquo; included, as I before said, all
flat stitches; and I repeat that &ldquo;feather application&rdquo; was
certainly its first motive; and next came the stitches
that conveyed the same desired effect, though a new
material was employed, fitted for the needle, which,
having served its apprenticeship in &ldquo;plain work,&rdquo; now
came to the front as a decorative agent.</p>

<p>Painting with the needle began with an attempt to
model with it; the lay of stitches being so arranged as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
give the whole effect of light and shadow, so as to
delineate the forms without changing the shades of the
material used. I give on the opposite page some
Japanese birds, which will explain what I mean. The
stitches are so intelligently placed as absolutely to give
the forms of the birds imitated. They represent plumage,
and a more artistic representation cannot be imagined.
(Pl. <a href="#pl43">43</a>.)</p>

<p>The same stitch which we find prevailing in China
and Japan as plumage work, is employed in embroidering
flowers. Here satin, stem, and plumage stitches are
blended together, and excellent decorative effects are produced;
but the texture of flowers is not to be imitated, as
is that of the plumage of birds. &ldquo;Satin&rdquo; stitch is a more
restricted form of plumage stitch; and &ldquo;stem&rdquo; is another
variety of these flat stitches, very useful in its place. I
therefore have assigned the name of &ldquo;plumage stitch&rdquo; to
that hitherto called &ldquo;embroidery&rdquo; or &ldquo;long and short&rdquo;
stitches; and I give the term &ldquo;plumage work&rdquo; to include
all the &ldquo;flat&rdquo; stitches.</p>

<p>Practically, it is allowed that these flat stitches,
especially the plumage stitch, give most scope for freedom
in needlework, as they are laid on at once, and according
to the inspiration of the worker, and may cover the outline
and efface it. The stitches are not counted, and have
more of the nature of touch than any others, as their
length, thickness, and closeness may be varied at will.
The artist&rsquo;s design thus admits of interpretation according
to the taste and feeling of the needlewoman.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Opus Consutum</span> (<i>or cut work</i>).</h4>

<p>This is &ldquo;Patchwork,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Appliqu&eacute;&rdquo; (&ldquo;inlaid&rdquo; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
&ldquo;onlaid&rdquo;). Vasari calls it &ldquo;Di commesso,&rdquo; and says that
Botticelli invented it for the use of Church banners, as
being much more effective than any other style of
work, or even than painting, as the outlines remained
firm (non si stinguano), and were not affected by the
weather (as in painted cloths) and were visible on both
sides of the banner. Botticelli drew with his own hand
the baldachino of Or San Michele, and the embroideries
on a frieze carried in procession by the monks of Santa
Maria Novella; he died 1515. Perhaps he may have
revived the art of application in his own day.</p>

<p>There are, however, much earlier examples of patchwork,
of which the first and most remarkable is the Egyptian
funeral tent of Queen Isi-em-Kheb, mother-in-law of Shishak,
who besieged and took Jerusalem three or four years
after the death of Solomon, <small>B.C.</small> 980. It may be described
as a mosaic, or patchwork of prodigious size, made of
thousands of pieces of gazelles&rsquo; skins, dyed, and neatly
sewn together with threads of colour to match, resembling
the stitching of a glove, the outer edges bound with a cord
of twisted pink leather, sewn on with stout pink thread
(pl. <a href="#pl44">44</a>). The colours are described as being wonderfully
preserved, when it is remembered that they are nearly as
old as the Trojan War; though perhaps their preservation
is less surprising than that the flowers wreathed about
several royal mummies of the same period should have
shown their colours and forms when the cases were first
opened, so as to be recognized as blue larkspur, yellow
mimosa, and a red Abyssinian flower, massed closely together
on the foundation of a strong leaf cut in zigzags.
Among the flowers lay a dead wasp, whose worthless
little form and identity were as perfectly preserved
as those of the mighty monarch on whose bosom
it had completed its short existence. The tent itself
consists of a centre or flat top, divided down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
middle, and covered over one half with pink and yellow
rosettes on a blue ground; on the other half are six
large vultures, each surrounded with a hieroglyphic text
which is really an epitaph. The side flaps are adorned
first with some narrow bands of colour; then with a
fringe pattern; then with a row of broad panels, red,
green, and yellow, with a device or picture and inscription
in the two other colours; on this border there are
kneeling gazelles, each with a pink Abyssinian lotus
blossom hanging to its collar. The rest of the side flaps
and the whole of the front and back flaps are composed
of large squares, alternately pink and green. This, for
its antiquity, its style, its stitchery, materials, and colours,
is a most interesting work of early art, and an example
of the perfection to which it had attained. It is remarkable
how much variety of effect has been produced with only
four colours, by the artistic manner of placing and contrasting
them. To our more advanced taste, however, the
whole effect of the contrasting colours is inharmonious
and gaudy, though certainly striking and typical.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

600 years later, Greek in its beauty of design and execution.
Alas! we can only ascertain, from tattered fragments
taken out of a tomb in the Crimea, that it was parsem&eacute;
with figures on horseback or in chariots. The border
is very beautiful. Compare the fragments of which we
have obtained a copy with the mantle of Demeter, from a
Greek vase, and you will perceive how the styles correspond
(Pl. <a href="#pl16">16</a>, Fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>). The ground material is of
the finest woven wool, of a deep violet or purple colour,
enriched with application of another fine woollen fabric
of a most brilliant green, worked down, outlined and
embroidered in white, black, and gold-coloured wool,
apparently in stem stitches.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> The accompanying illustration

<p>It is much to be regretted that the centre of the
mantle is so tattered and discoloured that it is impossible
to do more than ascertain that the design that is
embroidered on it consists of figures on horseback or in
chariots, in spirited attitudes. The second and broader
border is to be found (pl. <a href="#pl17">17</a>).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Opus consutum&rdquo; cannot in any sense perhaps be the
name of a stitch or stitches. But it applies to a peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
style of embroidery employing certain stitches. It is the
term given to all work cut out of plain or embroidered
materials, and applied by &ldquo;working down&rdquo; to another
material as grounding. It includes all raised and stuffed
application in silk, woollen, and metal thread work. It
has been given to all work in which the scissors are active
agents, whether in cutting out the outlines or in incising
the pattern, as in much of the linen and muslin embroideries
of our day, now called &ldquo;Madeira work,&rdquo; of
which a great deal was made in the first part of the
century by English ladies who designed and collected
patterns from each other, and gave the produce of their
industry as gifts to their friends for collars, cuffs, and
trimmings.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut work&rdquo; is named by Chaucer, and is constantly to
be found in inventories from his time to the beginning of
the last century. At Coire, in the Grisons, is a very
beautiful chasuble, of which the orphrey is of the school
of the elder Holbein or Lucas Cranach, applied and
raised so as to form a high relief. The figures are
covered with satin and embroidered. The chasuble
itself is of fine Saracenic silk, woven with golden inscriptions
in broad stripes. The colours are brown, crimson,
and gold.</p>

<p>In the later Middle Ages, a good deal of this work was
executed in Germany for wall hangings; figures were cut
out in different materials, and embroidered down and
finished by putting in the details in various stitches.
As art they are generally a failure, being more gaudy than
beautiful. This, however, is not necessarily the case, for
there is at the Hotel Cluny a complete suite of hangings
of the time of Francis the First, partly applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
and partly embroidered, which are beautiful in design
and colouring, especially the fruit and trophies in the
borders.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries cut work
was much employed in Italy for large flowered arabesque
designs, commonly in velvet or silk, making columnar
wall hangings, which are often very effective; giving
the rooms an architectural decoration, without interfering
with the arrangement of works of art, pictures,
statues and cabinets, placed in front of them. Besides,
it was supposed that the utmost effect of richness was
thus accomplished with the least labour, and very large
spaces and very high walls covered, without losing
anything of beauty by distance, as must be the case
when the work&rsquo;s highest merit is in the delicacy of the
stitches and the details of form. (Pl. <a href="#pl45">45</a>.)</p>

<p>The Earl of Beauchamp has inherited a most beautiful
suite of hangings of &ldquo;appliqu&eacute; work;&rdquo; silks of many
kinds are laid on a white brocade ground with every
possible variety of stitch, forming richly and gracefully designed
patterns; and showing to what cut work can aspire.</p>

<p>A great deal of &ldquo;opus consutum&rdquo; has been done in the
School of Art Needlework, in the way of restoration of old
embroideries. Here may be seen copies of different
models of many periods; amongst other British specimens,
part of a bed at Drumlanrig, in which James I. slept.
In this work the application is cut out, raised and stuffed,
and &ldquo;couched&rdquo; with cords, and the whole thing is as stiff,
strong, conventional, and enduring as if it were a piece
of upholstery that was carpentered yesterday, instead of
being needlework of at least 250 years ago.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable large works of this style
that exists was shown in 1881, at the South Kensington
Museum, during the Spanish Exhibition.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> It was of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
kind called &ldquo;on the stamp.&rdquo; This was a landscape
seen between columns wreathed with flowers and creepers.
In the foreground couched a stag, the size of life&mdash;a
wonderful reproduction of the hide of the creature in
stitches. The relief is so high that the columns appear
to be circular by the shadows they throw; and the stag
is stuffed so as to be raised about six inches. The work
is superb, and causes pleasure as well as wonder; and
yet, in spite of the beauty of the design, and the
richness of the materials&mdash;gold, silver, silk, and wool
profusely used&mdash;it is a divergence from the legitimate
art of embroidery, and is simply the attempt of the
needlewoman to combine again the arts of sculpture and
painting with the help of so inadequate an implement as
the needle. Therefore, except as being a marvellous and
beautiful curiosity, it is a failure; it is not art.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>Practically, cut work is the best mode of arriving at
splendid effects by uniting rich and varied tissues.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The
Italian curiosity vendors know this well, and often cut up
the remnants and rags of rich stuffs, old faded silks, and
scraps of gold and silver tissues, and with them copy fine
old designs, and sell them as authentic specimens of such
and such a date.</p>

<p>I was once requested to give an opinion as to the
date of a curtain border bought in Italy, and on
consideration I gave the following verdict: &ldquo;The design
is of the sixteenth century; the applied velvet and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
gold cord, of the seventeenth century; the brocaded silk
ground, eighteenth century; the thread with which the
whole was worked&mdash;machine-made silk thread (English)&mdash;middle
of nineteenth century.&rdquo; The whole effect was
excellent, and very antique.</p>

<p>This art of &ldquo;application&rdquo; is the distinctive part of the
&ldquo;opus consutum,&rdquo; and it is the best and most economical
method for restoration of old embroideries, of which the
grounding material is generally worn out long before the
stitches laid upon it. Much beautiful work has thus been
rescued from annihilation, and restored to use from its
long imprisonment in the boxes and drawers of the garret
and store-room. But it is cruel to transfer historical or
typical works, and so puzzle the artist and the historian.</p>

<p>It is so troublesome to embroider on velvet or plush,
or gold tissues, that application is the easiest and most
effective mode of dealing with these fabrics.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> The
outlines laid down in cord have the best effect, while
binding the edges and securing them from fraying, and
it is almost certain that the eye receives most pleasure, in
flat art, from a defined outline, which satisfies it; where
there are no cast shadows, it lifts the work from the
background, and separating the colours, it enhances
their beauty. It would appear, however, as a rule, that
either black or gold metal should invariably be employed,
because they do not interfere with any colour they
approach. White is distracting and aggressive. The
Greeks sometimes used gold colour instead of gold, as we
see in the mantle from the Crimea already referred to;
but this is not nearly so agreeable to the eye as pure
gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
A great deal of modern &ldquo;opus consutum,&rdquo; or application
cut work, has been done in Constantinople of late
years. The designs in general, are not artistic; nor
are the colouring and materials very commendable.
The onlaid material is, in general, sewn down with
chain stitches, and cut out afterwards.</p>


<h3><i>Part 7.</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lace.&mdash;Opus Filatorium or Araneum.</span></h4>

<p>Mrs. Palliser says that from the earliest times the
art of lace-making has been so mixed up with that of
needlework, that it is impossible to enter upon the one
without naming the other. This is, in fact, what she has
done, showing the intimate connection between the two
in her charming work on lace, where much information
about embroideries in general, may be found in the
introduction.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>M. Blanc also considers that there is but a slight
transition between embroidery and guipure, which he
says was the first lace.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> As all the earliest specimens
and designs for guipure were Venetian, the art was,
therefore, probably an Italian invention, though an
Oriental origin has sometimes been attributed to it. The
objection to this last theory is that we find no ancient
specimens, and no modern continuation of such work in
the East.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;guipure&rdquo; is a stumbling-block. It has
been applied to many forms in the varying art of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
lace-making; which same variableness has caused its
nomenclature to assume the terms belonging to other
textile arts where they approach or touch each other,
(as in netting, fringes, or embroideries). The nearest
approach to laces before the thirteenth century was more
in the nature of what we now call guimp.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>Embroidery differs from lace, in that it is worked on
already woven tissues; whereas lace is manufactured at
once, both ground and design.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> But the link between
the two is not missing.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century they worked &ldquo;opus filatorium,&rdquo;
which consisted of embroidery with the needle on linen,
of which half the threads had been drawn out, and the
remainder were worked into a net by knotting them
into groups, then dividing, and knotting them again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
There is a piece of work described in an old catalogue
quoted by Rock. &ldquo;St. Paul&rsquo;s, London, had a cushion
covered with knotted thread: Pulvinar copertum de
albo filo nodato.&rdquo; Here lace and embroidery touch
each other.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Sir Gardiner Wilkinson notices some
early Egyptian work in the Louvre as &ldquo;a piece
of white network pattern, each mesh containing an
irregular cubic figure.&rdquo; This sounds much like lace-work.</p>

<p>It may be fairly asserted that the term &ldquo;embroidery&rdquo;
embraces the craft of lace-making, as almost all ancient
and much modern lace is simple embroidery, and formed
entirely by the needle.</p>

<p>Some kinds of lace, however, are made by plaiting and
twisting the threads attached to bobbins round pins
which are previously arranged in the holes of a pattern,
pricked on parchment or glazed paper.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The original
motive and idea of lace is a net. The patterns called by
the ancients &ldquo;de fundata,&rdquo; are netted designs meshed.
You will see them constantly in Egyptian and Greek art,
both in wall painting and textile decoration. Homer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
speaks of golden cauls, and so does Isaiah,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> as adorning
women&rsquo;s heads. They also mention nets of flax.</p>

<p>The capitals of the brazen columns adorned with
&ldquo;nets of chequer work&rdquo; in Solomon&rsquo;s Temple are
very curious.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> And the author of &ldquo;Letters from Italy,
1776,&rdquo; tells of the garment of a statue at Portici,
edged with a border resembling fine netting. Egyptian
robes of state appear to have been sometimes
trimmed with an edging of a texture between lace and
fringe.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>Lace has been made of many materials in many ways.
We may instance &ldquo;passementerie,&rdquo; made with bobbins
(bone lace), with or without pins, or with the needle only,
by hand. The materials have been gold, silver, silk,
thread (these two last white or coloured), the fibres of
plants, and human hair.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> A lace called &ldquo;yak&rdquo; is made
of wool or hair.</p>

<p>Bone laces in gold and silver, or the two mixed and
interchanged, are continually mentioned in the inventories
of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries.
Bed hangings, chair and cushion covers, and table cloths
were constantly trimmed with gold and silver bone lace,
and fringes of the same.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Laces in coloured silks were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
made in Spain and the Balearic Isles late in the last
century.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>In 1542, a sumptuary law was passed in Venice, forbidding
the metal laces embroidered in silk to be wider
than &ldquo;due dita,&rdquo; i.e. about two inches. This paternal
interference in the details of life is truly Venetian. It
was intended to &ldquo;protect the nobles and citizens from
injuring themselves and setting a bad example.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps this strict rule was relaxed in favour of
crowned heads and royal personages; for there is at
Ashridge, among the relics of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s enforced
visit, a toilet-cover of red and gold striped silk, with a
trimming of lace, four inches broad, of Venice gold and
silver lace embroidered in coloured silk. Specimens of
these laces are rare, owing to the intrinsic value of the
metal. We must suppose the origin of these golden
trimmings to belong to a very early period. A piece of
gold wire lace guimp was lately found in a tomb
near Wareham, and is supposed, with reason, to be
Scandinavian.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>M. Blanc describes lace as a &ldquo;treillage&rdquo; or network,
and says it is made in three ways. You may complete
the ground first, and then work the pattern with the
needle. This he calls lace &ldquo;pure et simple;&rdquo; and he
considers that it differs from guipure in that the latter
consists of flowers and arabesques worked separately, and
then connected with bars, lines, or meshes. This guipure
is the second mode of lace-making.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> The third is by
machinery; but this has the inherent defect of all machine-made
fabrics, to a practised eye; i.e. a certain rigidity
and coldness in the exactly repeated forms, in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
the human touch is wanting. It is curious how in art,
even a &ldquo;pentimento&rdquo; is valuable, recalling the hand that
erred as well as created; the attention that strayed, or
reconsidered the design.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>M. Blanc, speaking of the beauty of point d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on,
praises it especially as being entirely needlework. He
names the different modes of lace-making, and judges
their merits. Of needle-made lace he says: &ldquo;And the
value of this lace not only arises from its representing a
considerable amount of labour, but also because nothing
can replace in human estimation the fabrics produced by
a man&rsquo;s, and still less by a woman&rsquo;s handicraft. However
the hand may have been restrained by the necessity of
faithfully following, on green parchment, the designs
imagined and traced by another person, there is always,
even in copying an outline, an individuality, an imperceptible
deviation to the right or to the left, above or
below the tracing, which impresses on the design the
accent of strength or weakness, of indecision or determination.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
I would add, of intelligence or stupidity; of
knowledge or ignorance.</p>

<p>This is not the first time, and will certainly not be the last,
that I shall have sought to impress on the needlewoman
the fact that her individuality cannot fail to be strongly
marked in her work; and I would urge her to carry out
the suggestions that her experience and her taste afford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
her, while seeking to render faithfully the original motive
of the designer. In lace-making, as in all art, the interest
and the life, as it were, is imparted to each specimen by
the attention and thought bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palliser shows us, by her beautiful illustrations,
how much variety may be given to designs for lace-making,
which have changed with each period of contemporary
art, and are markedly distinctive of their nationalities.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Cole&rsquo;s lectures on lace, his volume of photographs,
and M. Seguin&rsquo;s valuable work, are full of
information.</p>

<p>M. Urbani de Gheltof&rsquo;s &ldquo;Technical History of Venetian
Laces,&rdquo; translated into English by Lady Layard, is a
beautiful little book and a worthy imitation of the ancient
lace-books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>The subject has been so thoroughly discussed by adepts
in connection with its revival as a local industry in its
original cradle, that I will confine myself to a few
observations on its history and its place in decorative
art.</p>

<p>Fringes, Knotting, Netting, Knitting, Crochet, Tatting,
and Lace-making, are all parts of the same branch of
ornamental needlework. They are all &ldquo;trimmings,&rdquo; in
the sense of being decorative edges to more solid
materials. They are not available as coverings for
warmth or decency; but they serve to give the grace of
mystery to the object they drape or veil. They soften
the outlines and the colours beneath them, while they
permit them to peep through their meshes. They are
hardly to be included in what is called high art, having
more affinity with grace, refinement and coquetry, than
with &aelig;sthetic culture or noble thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
This tendency in lace work may be the reason that the
masculine mind does not, in general, appreciate these
lovely textures, but rather despises them (even when the
designs are beautiful and ingenious), as being flimsy and
deficient in honest intention; whereas women have always
greatly prized them for their delicacy and refinement,
and their great value, on account of the time, trouble,
and eyesight expended upon them. Their knowledge of
stitches also enables them to appreciate their variety, and
the taste shown in their selection and arrangement for
carrying out each design.</p>

<p>Lace stitches are almost innumerable.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Upwards of a
hundred are named, and their variations are endless.
But a volume would not suffice us for entering into the
details of the craft; many of its stitches have been imported
into embroideries in gold, silk, and crewels; and such
adaptations are always allowable, provided the effect is
good.</p>

<p>We have every reason to believe that the claims of
Venice as the first and original school of lace-making
have been satisfactorily proved.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Genoa, Florence, Milan,
especially the last,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> followed suit. Germany, France,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
and Spain soon started their schools; but Lady Layard
believes that Spain received all her inspiration and the
greater part of her laces from Venice, which likewise sent
teachers to France and to Brussels&mdash;or rather, we may
say, had many first-class workwomen decoyed from her
manufactories to assist in starting rival industries in other
countries.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>The first pattern-books were printed in Venice in the
sixteenth century; and these &ldquo;Corone di belle e virtuose
donne,&rdquo; as they are sometimes entitled,<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> were imitated in
France and Germany.</p>

<p>Venice was proud of her industry, and of the noble
ladies who fostered it. It is recorded in the &ldquo;Virt&ugrave; in
Giocco of Giovanna Palazzi&rdquo; that Giovanna Dandolo,
or &ldquo;la Dandola,&rdquo; (wife of the Doge Malapiero,) was the
first patroness of Venice laces. She also fostered the art
of printing in Venice, and is spoken of as a &ldquo;principessa
di gran&rsquo; spirito, ne di private fortune,&rdquo; and her memory is
cherished in connection with these proofs of her patriotism.
We hear also that Morosin or Marosin, wife of the Doge
Marin Grimani, patronized Venetian lace-making. Her
forewoman, or <i>maestra</i>, was a certain Cattina Gardin, and
through her the art was settled at Burano, where it has
been so lately revived.</p>

<p>At the Cathedral of Burano, is kept in the sacristy,
perhaps the finest existing piece of artistic lace of
the sixteenth century. It contains many groups of
figures from the history of our Lord, beautiful both in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
design and execution, worked in &ldquo;Punti Fogliami,&rdquo; and
filled in with exquisite tracery. This was the border of
an antipendium.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palliser laments the extinction of the art in
Venice, and says that but one woman of the old craft
had survived; but her elegy was premature, as that old
woman, by name Cencia Scarpariola, has lived to see
hundreds of girls at Burano reviving all the old traditions,
having learnt from her the secrets of the &ldquo;mestiere,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;mystery.&rdquo; Under the patronage of the Princess Margherita,
now Queen of Italy, and with the active help
and superintendence of Countess Adriana Marcello and
Princess Giovanelli, most beautiful laces are now made
in every old point, French and Flemish, as well as
Venetian. Pezzi, merli, and merletti are executed in
the different styles which include all lace-making, and of
which we here give a list from M. de Gheltof&rsquo;s book:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Net lace.<br />
Cut lace.<br />
Open lace.<br />
Flowered lace.<br />
Knotted lace.<br />
Darning or square netting.<br />
Venice point.<br />
Burano point.<br />
Drawn lace.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a><br />
Embroidered linen.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The price of these laces is very high, but not beyond
their value when we consider the vast amount of skilled
labour bestowed on them. We are often told that old
lace is cheaper than new, as an absurd fact, because the
antiquity of lace is supposed to add to its value. Yes, but
principally as an object of arch&aelig;ological interest; whereas
that which is being made now is supporting by its daily
wage the needlewoman and her family, and perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
providing for her old age; and as the strain on the eye is
very heavy, many lace-workers early in life lose their sight,
at least for all the purposes of their craft.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> For these
reasons we cannot say that the prices required for such
luxurious trimmings are unreasonable. Zanon da Udine
gives us an idea of how costly they were in old times.
He says that Giuseppe Berardi, a lace merchant in Venice,
made a profit of 75,000 francs on a commission for a set
of lace bed-hangings for the wedding of Joseph II.,
Emperor of Germany, which proves the high prices paid
for the new laces of their day.</p>

<p>Blond laces, which take their turn occasionally as
fashionable trimmings, veils, and Spanish mantillas, are
so called from their original Venetian name, &ldquo;merletti
biondi,&rdquo; pale laces. De Gheltof derives this appellation
from the celebrated collar of Louis Quatorze,
and fancies it was made of the fair hair of the workers;
but this is only vague conjecture. The term was applied
in the seventeenth century to laces in silk, gold, and
silver&mdash;never to thread laces. I confess I do not find
the reason for the name, but accept De Gheltof&rsquo;s information
that it was given by the authority of the magistrates
of Mercanzia in 1759.</p>

<p>This is but a very slight sketch of the history of lace.
Venice being its birthplace, and likewise the busy scene
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
of its rehabilitation, I have lingered over its school, and
left but little space for the discussion of those of Spain,
Flanders, Belgium, and France. But these have been
thoroughly investigated, and their individual merits are
well appreciated, both as antique and modern dress
decoration.</p>

<p>I have already said that the lace schools in France
were instituted by Colbert, who placed one at Auxerre,
under the especial care of his brother, the bishop of
that city. Louis Quatorze made it one of his splendid
caprices, and not only set the example, but forced the
fashion into this luxurious and extravagant channel.</p>

<p>In Spain, lace was made to look its best by being worn
stretched over the great hoops of the &ldquo;Guard-Infante;&rdquo;
and the fashion spread all over Europe. The white
laces, resembling carved ivory or those in gold and
silver, which remind one of solid jewellers&rsquo; work, when
spread over the surface of these fortified outworks,
guarding from all approach the persons of the Infantas
of Spain, assume in the portraits by Velasquez, a dignity
which is in keeping with their value. The splendid
designs show brilliantly on a background of scarlet, rose
colour, or black silk; and that which, hanging loosely,
looks only tawdry and ragged, had a magnificent effect
when thus displayed.</p>

<p>For ecclesiastical purposes, these grand solid laces seem
most appropriate, being effective in large spaces, and
easily seen at a distance, hanging over the edge of
the altar, as a border to the linen cloths, or finishing
the white alb of the officiating priest.</p>

<p>One cannot but agree with M. Blanc, who points
out that each piece of lace had its intention, and
that a fashionable ball-dress trimmed with the edging
of an antique altar-cloth in loops, is in false taste, to
say no worse of the misappropriation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
Though we have had no schools of lace in England
(unless we can call our imitative industries schools),
we have samplers of the time of Queen Elizabeth, and
down to the middle of the last century, showing that
drawn lace and cut lace were regularly taught, probably
as an accomplishment, by Italians. The laces of Devonshire
and the Isle of Wight (called Honiton) form a
group totally distinct from those of Northamptonshire,
Bedfordshire, and Oxfordshire, which last are very simple
cushion bobbin-laces.</p>

<p>From the sixteenth century English ladies have, for
their amusement, made cut laces. Still, we must confess
we have no national style of lace, and the only
enduring ones have been those of France and Belgium,
which have always kept the lead since their establishment,
though fluctuating in design with the varying
fashions of each epoch. Perhaps the reason of their
longevity is that they have followed always the taste of
their day. That of our time being decidedly arch&aelig;ological,
ancient patterns are now the most successful.</p>

<p>There is a kind of embroidery darned-work, called
&ldquo;Limerick lace,&rdquo; which is said to be only made in
Ireland, and being partly machine-made, is not pure lace,
and therefore little esteemed. Very fine thread laces
have been produced at Irish work schools; but no
commercial result has followed. Clever imitations of
Venice point have come from Ireland lately, called &ldquo;raised
crochet.&rdquo; This is a novelty, and it is extremely fine
and beautiful work.</p>

<p>The Exhibition of Irish Lace in London (June, 1883),
shows how widespread have been the efforts of Irish
ladies to employ the peculiar genius of the sister island
for delicate work with the needle, which has always been
shown in their beautiful embroideries on muslin and
cambric. It appears that every kind of lace, except,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
perhaps, Brussels point, has been made in Ireland within
the last 180 years; but as in each case the effort was
always that of one individual woman, the school fell away
when she died.</p>

<p>The names of these ladies are now worthily recorded
in the official catalogue of the exhibition, with photographs
of the specimens produced under their superintendence
and care. Perhaps a permanent industry may
crown, however late, their exertions to help the women
of Ireland.</p>


<h3><i>Part 8.</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Tapestry&mdash;Opus Pectineum.</span></h4>

<p>It is necessary to define precisely what is meant by the
word &ldquo;tapestry.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> The term has been applied to all
hangings, and so caused confusion between those that are
embroidered with a design, on a plain or brocaded woven
material, and those which are inwoven with the design
from the first.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> This latter was called in classical language,
&ldquo;opus pectineum,&rdquo; because it was woven with the help of
a comb (the &ldquo;slay&rdquo;),<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> to push the threads tight between
each row of stitches; and the individual stitches were put
in with a sort of a needle, or by the fingers only, and laid
on the warp. It was thus practised by the Egyptians,
by the Persians, Indians, and Peruvians; and in Egypt
was often finished by embroidery. (Pl. <a href="#pl46">46</a>.) In Egyptian
tombs we have evidence of their tapestry, from the mural
paintings representing men and women weaving pictures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
in upright looms. The comb which served to push the
threads together after the stitches were laid in is sometimes
found in the weaver&rsquo;s tomb.</p>

<p>We have, in the British Museum, pieces of &ldquo;opus
pectineum&rdquo; from Saccarah, in Egypt; and also fragments
from a Peruvian tomb, of barbarous design, but the
weaving is equal to the Egyptian; and both resemble
the Gobelins weaving of to-day. Whence came the craft
of the Peruvians?</p>

<p>Tapestry is woven in two ways, by a high or by a
low-warp loom (<i>haute-lisse</i> or <i>basse-lisse</i>), vertical or
horizontal. The &ldquo;slay&rdquo; is the implement which is
peculiar to the craft. I shall not enter into any description
of the mode of working the looms, as this has been
thoroughly well done by masters of the art.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> But I
would call attention to the Frontispiece, copied from a
Greek vase, where Penelope is portrayed sitting by her
<i>haute-lisse</i> frame. I also refer the reader to the illustration
from the Rheims tapestries, in which a medi&aelig;val
artist shows the Blessed Virgin weaving at one that is
horizontal or &ldquo;basse-lisse.&rdquo; (Pl. <a href="#pl47">47</a>.)</p>

<p>For the best information I have been able to obtain
regarding tapestry weaving, I must acknowledge my
indebtedness to M. Albert Castel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Biblioth&egrave;que des
Merveilles.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> He has given great care to the consideration
of this subject, and has collected good evidences
to prove his conclusions, which I willingly accept <i>en
bloc</i>. Of course he has chiefly dealt with the French
branch of the art, and with the Flemish, from which it
immediately descends. He begins, however, by quoting
Pliny, to prove the antiquity of weaving, and gives a verse
of Martial&rsquo;s to this effect: &ldquo;Thou owest this work to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
land of Memphis, where the slay of the Nile has vanquished
the needle of Babylon.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Homer makes Helen weave the story of the siege of
Troy; this may have been partly embroidered; and
there are some pieces of woven tapestry introduced most
ingeniously into the web of a linen shirt or garment, of
which the sleeve is in the Egyptian department of the
British Museum, proving that figures were pictured
by weaving quite as early as the date of Troy, and
unmistakably finished with the needle (Plate <a href="#pl18">18</a>); at
any rate, as early as the days of Homer. Arachne&rsquo;s web
was interwoven with figures. She and Minerva rivalled
each other in ingenious design and perfect execution.
The description of the beautiful hangings they wove, the
glorious colours with their tenderly graduated tints, and
the graceful borders, appear to be almost prophetic of the
highest efforts of the looms of the Gobelins.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a><a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Arachne&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
name is derived from the Hebrew word for weaving,
&ldquo;Arag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It appears that the town now called Arras, but anciently
Nomenticum, was always a centre of the trade of
the weavers;<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> for Flavius Vopiscus, writing in <small>A.D.</small> 282,
says that thence came the Byrri&mdash;woven cloaks with hoods,
which were much in vogue amongst all classes in the later
Roman Empire. The craft of weaving, which flourished
in the Flemish and other adjacent countries, seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
have become native to that soil, and to have clung to it,
surviving many historical cataclysms.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>Though in the fifth century the inhabitants of that
country were transported wholesale to Germany by the
Vandals, and among them those of the town of Arras,
yet, thanks to the monasteries, there was a survival and a
revival; the craftsmen grouping themselves round the
religious houses. Specimens as models were brought
from the East. Aster, Bishop of Amasis (a town in Asiatic
Turkey), describes these Oriental hangings in one of his
homilies. He says that animals and scenes from the
Bible were woven on white grounds.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>Sidonius Apollinaris, Bishop of Clermont Ferrand,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> says
that some foreign tapestries are &ldquo;pictured&rdquo; with the
summits of Ctesiphon and Nephates, &ldquo;wild beasts running
rapidly across void canvas, and also by a miracle
of art, the Parthian of wild aspect with his head turned
backwards.&rdquo; This might be a description of a Chinese
composition, and probably it is so.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>Woven tapestry is also called &ldquo;Arras,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> because that
town in the Netherlands was the home and school of
the art of picture weaving in the Middle Ages. It has
been hitherto excluded from the domain of needlework,
because of the different use of the needle employed in it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
It has always been woven on a loom, and is, in fact,
embroidery combined with the weaving; for the
shuttle, or slay, or comb completes each row of stitches.
It belongs as much to our art as does tambour work,
which is done with a hook instead of a needle. Tapestry
weaving is the intelligent craft of a practised hand
guided by artistic skill. The forms of the painted design
must be copied by a person who can draw; and the
colours require as much care in selection, as in painting
with oils or water-colours. Such a thing as a purely
mechanical exact copy is impossible in any art; and the
difficulties are increased a hundredfold when it is a
translation into another material, and another form of
art. Besides, in this case, the copies are worked from the
back, and the picture is reversed. The question is this:
Can it be claimed as belonging to the same craft as embroidery?
I answer in the affirmative, and I claim it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the Saracens began to weave tapestry we
cannot tell; but the workers in woven pictures were
called Sarassins, and their craft, the &lsquo;opus Saracenicum.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
The French and Flemish artisans who
continued to weave in the old upright frames (<i>haute-lisse</i>)
were, whether Christians or not, called &ldquo;Sarassins.&rdquo; Probably
they came through Spain, possibly from Sicily to
Flanders and to France, or else from Byzantium. Viollet-le-Duc
says that the &ldquo;Saracinois&rdquo; was a term applied to
the makers of velvety carpets (<i>tapis velout&eacute;s</i>).<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
possible.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Woven carpets of Oriental type were
spreading themselves as articles of luxury through
Europe early in the Middle Ages; and the Persian style
of design was much the same then, when the first models
were brought to Spain, and thence to Arras, as it is now
in the carpets we buy just woven in Persia.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> The oldest
specimens known here have been exhibited in the Indian
Museum, and may be of the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. The perishable nature of the material makes
us dependent on the sculptured records of all artistic
design for our knowledge of carpets and hangings of
more than a thousand years ago; and we must confess
that we find nothing really resembling a Persian pattern
in any classical tomb or sculpture of the Dark Ages.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
I have allowed myself to touch upon carpet weaving,
as it is germane to tapestry; though it is a branch that
soon loses itself and leaves artistic work in the distance.
Except the first design, it has become purely mechanical.</p>

<p>After what has been quoted from Ovid&rsquo;s &ldquo;Metamorphoses,&rdquo;
and bearing in mind the pictured webs described
by Homer, and likewise the evidence of the
frescoes in Egypt, and the woman weaving on the Greek
fictile vase found at Chiusi, we may be justified in
concluding that, like all other arts, that of tapestry existed
in very early days, died out, and had to begin afresh,
and gradually return to life, during the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Bishop Gaudry, about 925, possessing a piece
of tapestry with an inscription in Greek letters surrounded
by lions &ldquo;parsem&eacute;,&rdquo; was much put about till he
obtained something to match it, to hang on the opposite
side of his choir at Auxerre.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> And it is known that the
monks of St. Florent, at Saumur, wove tapestries about
985, and continued to do so for two centuries. St.
Angelme of Norway,<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Bishop of Auxerre, who died in
840, caused many tapestries to be executed for his
church. At Poitiers this manufactory was so famous in
the eleventh century, that foreign kings, princes, and
prelates sought to obtain them, &ldquo;even for Italy.&rdquo; The
rules of their order of the monks of the Abbey of Cluny,
dated 1009, were followed by those of St. Wast and of
the Abbey of Fleury, and others in France, who all
wove wool and silk for tapestries. Le P&egrave;re Labb&eacute;, from
whom much of this information is drawn and acknowledged
by M. Charton (my authority), says that in
876, at Ponthi&egrave;vre, in presence of the Emperor Charles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
the Bold, the hall of the council-chamber was hung with
pictured tapestries, and the seats were covered with
them.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>Arras continued to lead as the great tapestry factory
till the end of the fifteenth century, when the commercial
failure of the city began, at the death of Charles le
T&eacute;m&eacute;raire, Duke of Burgundy.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Plate <a href="#pl48">48</a> shows a

portion of his tent hangings woven with the order of
the golden fleece taken at the battle of Grandson&mdash;now
in the museum at Berne. Till then Arras had supplied
most of the splendid decorations of which we
find such marvellous lists. Every possible subject&mdash;religious,
romantic, historical, and allegorical&mdash;was pressed
into the service, and pictured hangings were supposed
to instruct, amuse, and edify the beholders. The dark
ages were illuminated, and their barbarity softened, by
these constant appeals to men&rsquo;s highest instincts, and to
the memories of their noblest antecedents and aspirations,
which clothed their walls, and so became a part of
their daily lives. The great Flemish and French workshops
became the illustrators of the history of the world,
as it was then read or being enacted. It is a record of
faiths, religious and political; and of national and family
lives and their changes. The Exhibition at Brussels in
1880 showed, by its &ldquo;Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;,&rdquo; how much
could be extracted from its storied tapestries of both
arch&aelig;ological and artistic information.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>Though the art continued to be the servant of refined
luxury in the fifteenth century, Arras itself had done its
work,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> and was superseded as the greatest weaver of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
artistic tapestry by a neighbour and rival. Brussels,
which had been gradually asserting itself as a weaving
community, from that date absorbed most of the trade of
Arras, and thence forwards, till Henri IV. established
the works of the Savonnerie, Brussels led European
taste, and employed the best artists. Brussels employed
Leonardo da Vinci and Mantegna, Giovanni da Udine,
Raphael, and later, Rubens and the great Dutch painters,
to design cartoons for tapestry works. Raphael&rsquo;s pupil,
Michael Coxsius, of Mechlin, superintended the copying
of his master&rsquo;s cartoons. Shortly afterwards, Antwerp,
Oudenarde, Lille, Tournai, Valenciennes, Beauvais,
Aubusson, and Bruges all had their schools;<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> and
the adept can trace their differences and peculiarities,
and name their birthplace, without referring to their
trade-mark, or to that of the manufacturer, which is
usually to be found in the outer border. Poitiers,
Troyes, Beauvais, Rheims, and St. Quentin likewise
had their schools, and became famous.</p>

<p>Want of space prevents my entering more fully into
this subject of the northern tapestries, and I must refer
my readers to the authorities I have quoted from so
largely.</p>


<h5>ITALIAN TAPESTRY.</h5>

<p>The word Arrazzi shows us whence the Italians drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
their art. Doubtless there were looms in the Italian
cities, and especially under ecclesiastical patronage,
through the dark ages. Rome was in communication
with the Atrebates in the third century, by whom she
was supplied with the Byrri, or hooded cloaks then
worn; and as it had been a centre for weaving commerce,
it is probable that Rome received from Arras the craftsmen
as well as the produce of their looms. At the
Renaissance we find factories for pictured webs in
Florence, Rome, Milan, Mantua, and elsewhere. The
best artists of the Italian schools&mdash;Mantegna, Leonardo,
Raphael and his scholars, &amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;gave their finest
designs to be executed in Italy, before they were sold to
Arras, Brussels, France, or England, and they are accumulated
in the treasure-room of every palace in Italy.
But the finest collections are those of the Vatican, and of
the Pitti in Florence. A splendid volume might be
edited of these grand artistic works; such a record
would be invaluable. Vasari<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> and Passevant give us
occasional glimpses of local factories for tapestry, but,
as we have before said, this subject has still to be investigated.</p>


<h5>FRENCH TAPESTRY.</h5>

<p>In France, as elsewhere, tapestry was probably woven
in private looms and in the religious houses from early
days. M. Jubinal believes that it was made at Poitiers,
Troyes, Beauvais, Rheims, and St. Quentin as early as
1025.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Froissart describes the entry of Isabel of Bavaria
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
as a bride into Paris, when the houses were covered
with hangings and tapestries representing historical
scenes.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> The Cluny Museum possesses a most curious
medi&aelig;val suite of hangings from the Chateau de
Boussac, of the early part of the fifteenth century. They
tell the story of the &ldquo;Dame au Lion,&rdquo; and are brilliantly
coloured and charmingly quaint and gay in design.
Hangings designed by Primaticcio were woven at
Fontainebleau, where Francis I. started the manufacture
in 1539. However, the first national school of
tapestry weaving was that at Chaillot, under the experienced
teaching of workmen from Arras; afterwards
transferred to the town of Gobelins, 1603, by Henri
Quatre.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Louis Quatorze and his minister Colbert
splendidly protected this manufacture by law, privilege,
and employment; so did Louis Quinze. Before
the Revolution, other considerable tapestry works were
flourishing at Aubusson in Auvergne, at Felletin in the
upper Marches, and at Beauvais. These two last were
especially famed for velvety tapestries (<i>velout&eacute;s</i>).</p>

<p>As usual, the French have surpassed all other nations
in this textile art. The pictorial tapestries of the Gobelins
have carried the beauty of wall hangings to the utmost
perfection. Nothing can be more festive than a brilliantly
lighted hall, glowing with these woven pictures or
arabesques, framed in gilded carvings or stuccoes. Still
we must acknowledge that, in choice of worthy subjects,
the Flemish ideal, which had been left far behind, was
the highest. The weavers of the time of Louis Quatorze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
aspired only to teach the glories of France, not the
moralities of society and civilization, in their historical
compositions, which were then superseded by classical
mythology, or else by scenes from rustic life, of the
Watteau School. La Fontaine&rsquo;s fables gave some of
the prettiest and gayest designs, and were generally
the centres of splendid arabesques. The drawing and
execution were perfect.</p>

<p>It is to be feared that in the future, great works of textile
decoration will be few and far between. It is only when the
State, or the monarch that represents the dignity of the
State, protects and fosters these artistic factories, that they
can continue to thrive. Without such powerful encouragement,
fashion, commercial depression, or a war will stop
for a time the orders without which funds fail, discouragement
sets in, and ruin quickly follows; and the best
workman when unemployed, or forced for some years to
wield the sword, loses his practised skill never to be
restored. In France, whatever has been the form of
government, the old traditions of protection for the
Gobelins have been acted up to and maintained. The
consequence is that science and art still contribute their
efforts in the machinery, the colouring, and the designing
of hangings of which the materials<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> and the execution
are unrivalled. Probably there will never again be a
Tuileries or a Versailles to adorn, but an H&ocirc;tel de
Ville, especially if it is occasionally destroyed, may give

<p>When we consider the antiquity and the excellence of
the art of tapestry on the Continent, we cannot pretend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
that there can be the same general interest in that of
our English looms. But to ourselves it naturally assumes
the greatest importance; and I have tried to trace the
efforts of our ancestors in this direction, by noting every
certain sign of English production, in what must have
been an imitation of Flemish or Oriental weaving. The
few facts here collected may be of service to the future
writer of the history of English tapestries.</p>

<p>Comnenus, Prince of Arras, fled before the Romans
from Nomenticum to England; and he and his Atrebates
settled themselves between Silchester and Sarum, and
the Belg&aelig; and Parisi did the same. The Romans
found them here when they invaded England. Wherever
the Belgic tribes spread themselves, the art of
weaving was established. Comnenus probably brought
over, and left to his descendants, the inheritance of this
craft.</p>

<p>Dr. Rock thinks that pictured tapestry was woven at
an early period in the Middle Ages by the monks in
England. The earliest proof of this that we possess,
is the notice by Matthew Paris (thirteenth century)
describing the three reredos for St. Alban&rsquo;s Abbey;
the first, a large one, depicting the finding of the body
of the Protomartyr; the others, &ldquo;The Prodigal Son&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Man who fell among Thieves.&rdquo; All these were
executed by the orders of Abbot Geoffrey.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>While in London in 1316, Simon, Abbot of Ramsay,
bought for the use of his monks, looms, shuttles, and a
slay. &ldquo;Pro weblomes emptes xx<sup>d</sup>. Et pro staves ad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>

<p>In Edward II.&rsquo;s time there were hangings woven in
England which appear to have been absolutely tapestries.
They were much valued abroad, and were called &ldquo;Salles
d&rsquo;Angleterre.&rdquo; Charles V. of France (1364) possessed
among his articles of costly furniture, &ldquo;Une salle d&rsquo;Angleterre
vermeille brod&eacute;e d&rsquo;azur, et est la bordure a vignettes,
et le dedans de Lyons, d&rsquo;Aigles, et de Lyopars.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>Our trade with Arras must have improved our tapestries.
We are told of Edward III. selling his wools to that
town, and being therefore called by Philip de Valois, his
&ldquo;Marchant de Laine.&rdquo; Horace Walpole refers to an
act, &ldquo;De Myster&acirc; Tapiciarorum,&rdquo; of the time of Edward
III., 1327, &ldquo;regarding certain malpractices of the craft,&rdquo;
which proves its existence in England at that period.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>Mr. French, in his catalogue of the Exhibition in
London, 1851, quotes the tapestries of St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall
at Coventry, to prove that there was a manufactory
in England, <i>temp.</i> Henry VI. There were certainly
individual looms, though we doubt whether it had yet
become a national industry, as we have so few specimens
remaining. The St. Mary&rsquo;s tapestries contain portraits of
Henry VI., Cardinal Beaufort, &amp;c., and are probably
contemporary works. The subject is the marriage of
Henry VI.</p>

<p>There is also a piece of tapestry at Bude, in Cornwall,
the property of Mr. Maskell, which came from a royal
sale. Here the marriage of Henry VII. is depicted, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
the style resembles that of the Coventry hangings. The
costumes are certainly English, and the original pictures
must have been English, though they might have been
wrought at Arras, reminding one of the groups of figures
and the dresses on the Dunstable Pall (see Plate <a href="#pl78">78</a>).</p>

<p>Dr. Rock also quotes the reredos belonging to the
Vintners&rsquo; Company, representing St. Martin sharing his
cloak with a beggar. He thinks this is executed by
the monks of St. Alban&rsquo;s, and attributes to those of
Canterbury the fine tapestries of the legends of the
Virgin at Aix, in Provence, of which we have the
history. They were originally given to Canterbury
Cathedral by Prior Godstone, and were called Arras
work. There is no doubt that there were looms and
artists in the convents and monasteries before there
was any recognized school of such work in England.
Probably till the Reformation such hangings were being
woven all over Europe, and only then ceased in Germany
and England. One cannot but regret that the
weight of the evil which preponderated over the good
in the Houses of the Church, should have caused so
much that was beautiful in art to be crushed by their
ruin.</p>

<p>Chaucer speaks of &ldquo;tapestry of verd.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> This green
tapestry seems to have been intended to give a bowery
effect to the room it hung; and one can imagine that it
pleased the taste of the poet of the &ldquo;Flower and the
Leaf.&rdquo; It seems to have been much the fashion in
England and elsewhere about that period, and generally
represented landscapes and woody foregrounds only; but
sometimes figures and animals were portrayed, and
always in the same tints of bluish-green.</p>

<p>Dr. Rock gives us an extract from the wardrobe
accounts of Edward II., containing the following items:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
&ldquo;To a mercer of London for a green hanging of wool,
woven with figures of kings and earls upon it; for the
king&rsquo;s service upon solemn feast days in London;&rdquo; therefore
the &ldquo;tapestry of verd&rdquo; was not a novelty even in the
time of Chaucer.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>Oudenarde was famous for these &ldquo;hallings&rdquo; or &ldquo;salles.&rdquo;
All the specimens mentioned in the catalogue of tapestries
exhibited at Brussels in 1880, are said to be from thence.
But we see no reason why it should not have been
an English style of weaving also. The first establishment
of a permanent manufactory in England, did not,
however, take place until the latter end of the reign
of Henry VIII., when Robert Sheldon &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; his
manor-house at Barcheston, in Warwickshire, to &ldquo;one
Hicks,&rdquo; whom he signalizes in his will as &ldquo;the author
and beginner of all tapestry of Arras in England.&rdquo; This
will is dated 1576.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p class="caption">SUMMER<br />
English Tapestry, Temp. Henry VIII.
at Hatfield</p>

<p>There are four pieces of tapestry representing the
Seasons, removed from an old family house and placed
by Lord Salisbury at Hatfield House, where they hang
in the great corridor. These were probably woven in
Barcheston. (Plate <a href="#pl49">49</a>.) The style is English Renaissance,
and the design full of intention; in fact, they
have the seal of the time of Henry VIII. Only one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
characteristic reminds one of Flemish art, and that is the
mode of drawing the plants and flowers, which might
have been taken out of an old German herbal. The
landscapes and peasantry are unmistakably English.
The pictures are worked with strong black outlines
which emphasize every detail and give the effect
of a highly coloured outlined engraving; reminding one
of the children&rsquo;s books by Marcus Ward or by Walter
Crane.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>The tapestries called the &ldquo;Spanish Armada hangings&rdquo;
were probably woven here late in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign. In
her time we find in catalogues of household goods,
descriptions of splendid hangings, furnishings of palaces
and private houses. The MS. inventory of the Earl
of Leicester&rsquo;s belongings, in the library at Longleat,
astonishes us with the abundance of suites of hangings
of tapestry that it enumerates, as well as those embroidered
by hand, and others of stamped and painted
leather.</p>

<p>It was in the reign of James I. that the manufacture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
was set up at Mortlake, in Surrey. Aubrey, in his
&ldquo;History of Surrey, i. p. 82,&rdquo; however, dates the institution
in the subsequent reign; but Lloyd<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> is not only
positive for the former date, but affirms it was &ldquo;of the
motion of King James himself,&rdquo; who gave &pound;2000 towards
the undertaking; and we have further proofs extant that
he spent largely, and encouraged it in every way. He
gave to Sir Francis Crane, who erected the house at
Mortlake, &ldquo;the making of three Baronets&rdquo; towards his
project for manufacture of tapestry.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>Another curious item which we quote, shows that the
funds for the enterprise were not easily forthcoming. It
is a warrant &ldquo;to Sir Francis Crane: &pound;2000 to be employed
in buying &pound;1000 per ann. of pensions or other
gifts made of the king, and not yet payable, for ease of His
Majesty&rsquo;s charge of &pound;1000 a year towards the maintenance
of Sir Francis Crane&rsquo;s tapestry manufacture.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>Apparently this little arrangement did not succeed, for
there is an acknowledgment by Charles I., in the first
year of his reign,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> that he is in debt to Sir F. Crane:
&ldquo;For three suits of gold tapestry we stand indebted
to Sir Francis Crane &pound;6000. Also Sir F. Crane is
allowed &pound;1000 annually for the better maintenance of
said works for ten years to come.&rdquo; The king also
granted the estate of Stoke Bruere, near Stamford,
in Northamptonshire, as part payment of &pound;16,400
due to him on the tapestry works at Mortlake.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> The
great value of these tapestries is shown by the prices
named in the Domestic Papers of the State Paper Office,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
and in private inventories; they were woven in silk, wool,
and gold, which last item accounts both for their price
and for their disappearance.</p>

<p>William, Archbishop of York and Lord Keeper, gave
&pound;2500 for four pieces of Arras representing the four
Seasons.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Their value, however, fell during the civil
wars, for the tapestries of the five Senses from the
Palace of Oatlands, which were from the Mortlake looms,
were sold in 1649 for &pound;270. The beautiful tapestries at
Houghton were woven at Mortlake: these are all silk,
and contain whole length portraits of James I. and
Charles I., and their Queens, with heads of the royal
children in the borders. A similar hanging is at Knowle,
wrought in silk, containing portraits of Vandyke and Sir
Francis Crane.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>Francis Cleyne was a decorator and painter employed
in the works at Mortlake by Charles I., who,
while he was still Prince of Wales, brought him over to
England from Rostock, in Mecklenburg (his native place),
while the Prince was in Spain wooing the Infanta.
Cleyne was great in grotesques, and also undertook in
historical designs.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>Three of the Raphael cartoons were sent to be copied
at Mortlake.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> The purchase of these cartoons by the
king, showed how high was the standard to which he tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
to raise the art in England. The &ldquo;Triumph of C&aelig;sar,&rdquo;
by Mantegna, was obtained for the same purpose in
1653; and certain Dutch prisoners were forwarded to
the manufactory to be employed on the work.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> It was
entrusted to the care of Sir Gilbert Pickering, who was
either an artist or the superintendent of the works.</p>

<p>After the death of Sir Francis, his brother, Sir Richard
Crane, sold the premises to Charles I. During the
civil wars, the property was seized upon and confiscated
as having belonged to the Crown. It occupied the site
of what is now Queen&rsquo;s Head Court. The old house
opposite was built by the king for the residence of Cleyne
the artist. Gibson, the dwarf, and portrait painter, who
had been page to a lady at Mortlake, was one of his
pupils.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>The value of the king&rsquo;s collection of tapestries was well
understood during the Protectorate. The tapestry house
remained in the occupation of John Holliburie, the &ldquo;master-workman.&rdquo;
After the Restoration, Charles II. appointed
Verrio as designer, intending to revive the manufactory.
This was not, however, carried out; but the work
still lingered on, and must have been in some repute, for
Evelyn names some of these hangings as a fit present
among those offered by a gallant to his mistress.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>Arras is said to have been woven at Stamford, but we
have no data of its establishment or its suppression.
Burleigh House contains much of it; and there is a suite
of hangings at Belton House, near Grantham, of which
there are duplicates at Wroxton House, in Oxfordshire,
all having the same traditional origin at Stamford.
Possibly Sir Francis and Sir Richard Crane may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
received orders at their house at Stoke Bruere, which
lay near enough to Stamford to account for the magnates
of the town and neighbourhood obtaining furnishings of
their tapestries, and, perhaps, vying with each other in
decorating their apartments with them.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>In Northumberland House there was a fine suite of
tapestry, woven in Lambeth, 1758.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> This is the only
sample of that loom of which we ever find any mention.
There were also works at Fulham, where furniture
tapestry in the style of Beauvais was made. This
manufactory was closed in 1755.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> It may be hoped that
the revival of tapestry weaving at Windsor in our own
day may be a success, but without the royal and noble
encouragement it receives, it would probably very soon
fall into disuse.</p>

<p>Unless it is supported by the State, such an exceptionally
expensive machinery cannot possibly be kept at
work. It requires the superintendence of the best artists,
and the weavers themselves must needs have the highest
technical education to enable them to copy really fine
designs. These artistic requirements, besides the
extreme tediousness of the work, make it the most
expensive of all luxurious decorations&mdash;even more costly
than embroideries by the hand, covering the same
spaces. However, the two styles of hangings never can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
enter into competition, except in a financial point of view.
Tapestries are the best fitted for wall coverings, and
embroideries for curtains of all kinds&mdash;for beds, for
windows, and for porti&egrave;res.</p>

<p>The old hangings are now again having their day,
and we are striving to save and restore all that remain
to us. We must continue to guard these treasures from
the moths, their worst enemies; and science should be
invoked to assist us in the preservation of these precious
works of art, of which the value is now again understood
and appreciated, and which increases with every decade
that is added to their antiquity.</p>

<p>Tapestry, as art, has its own peculiar beauties, and
one of them is the softening, yet brilliant effect of the
alternate lights and shadows of the ridge-like surface;
the separation of each stitch and thread also casting
minute shadows in the opposite direction, and giving an
iridescent effect. It is a mistake to struggle against this
inherent quality, instead of seeking to utilize it. The
coarser and simpler tapestries of our ancestors are really
more beautiful and effective in large spaces&mdash;flat in the
arrangement of colours, and sharply outlined&mdash;than the
imitations of paintings of the last two centuries, in which
every detail of form and colour is sought to be expressed.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>M. Blanc says that tapestries were intended to cover
the bare walls, but not to make us forget their existence.
The wall being intended for comfort and defence, the
mind is solaced with the idea it conveys. It is a mistake,
therefore, to substitute a surface picture, so real that it at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
once does away with this impression of security, while a
certain conventional art should amuse the mind with
shadowy representations and suggestions.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, fortunate that the possibilities of tapestry
weaving are restricted, and thus its very imperfections
become the sources of its best qualities as decoration and
comfort. One element of textile weaving, the use of
gold, both in the backgrounds and in the draperies, takes
it at once out of the region of naturalism, while giving it
light and splendour.</p>

<p>The designer for tapestry need not be a great genius.
Harmony, repose, grace, and tender colouring are the
qualities most valuable to such an artist. Battle-pieces,
and other exciting and awful subjects, are only bearable
in apartments that are used for state occasions, or for
hanging corridors and anterooms. They are painful to
live with.</p>

<p>All tapestries are liable to suffer by the double nature
of their materials&mdash;their woollen surface and linen threads
which are affected by both damp and heat crinkling the
forms and puckering the faces, and bringing out unexpected
expressions and deformities. For this reason the
design should be as flat and as simple in its outline and
shading as is consistent with beauty.</p>

and names some specimens in the South Kensington Museum.
He says it was sometimes done in darning stitches for ecclesiastical
purposes, for instance, for coverings for the pyx. It is mentioned in
the Exeter inventory of the fourteenth century. There is notice of
white knotted thread-work belonging to St. Paul&rsquo;s, London, in 1295,

In the Museum at Munich are two remarkable examples of these
imitations. There is an embroidered badge of the Order of the Dragon,
worked in gold and woven over with coloured silks, so as to present the
appearance of enamel (sixteenth century). The second is a dress for a
herald of the Order of St. Hubertus, which is richly embroidered in
gold and silver, and the badge and collar are imitated in the most
extraordinary manner, and laid on entirely in gold needlework. This is
of the seventeenth century.</p>

The Plumarii mentioned by Pliny were craftsmen in the art of
<i>acu pingere</i>, or painting with the needle. Though Seneca speaks of
the &ldquo;opus plumarium&rdquo; as if it were absolutely feather-work, yet it may
have been at that time undergoing its transition into embroidery,
suggested by feathers, and imitating them in gold, silver, wool, or
thread. When Lucan describes the extraordinary change introduced
into Roman habits and luxury by Cleopatra&rsquo;s splendours, his use of the
words, &ldquo;pars auro plumata nitet,&rdquo; probably means their imitation or
mixture with gold embroidery, and would, therefore, come under the
head of &ldquo;opus Phrygium.&rdquo;</p>

Mrs. Bayman (late Superintendent in the School of Art Needlework)
writes thus: &ldquo;I see no reason to doubt that the word guipure is
derived from &lsquo;guipa&rsquo; or &lsquo;guiper,&rsquo; a ribbon-weaver&rsquo;s term for spinning
one thread round another; and that guipure was originally more like
what we now call &lsquo;guimp,&rsquo; or like &lsquo;point de Raguse,&rsquo; first being made
of thread, of more or less thickness and commoner material, wound
round with a finer flax, silk, or metal; then they cut shapes, bold
scrolls, and leaves out of cartisane, vellum, or parchment, winding
and covering them over with the more precious thread. These figures
were then connected by brides, only as close as was required to hold
them together, and leaving large open spaces, thus forming the large scroll
patterns seen in so many old pictures.&rdquo; No doubt the heavy &ldquo;Fogliami&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Rose point&rdquo; laces developed themselves from these still older kinds
of point. As the cord and card lace disappeared, the name slid on to
all laces with large, bold patterns and open brides, though the special
method which first created it had been effaced. Latterly, embroidered
netting or laces have been called &ldquo;guipure d&rsquo;art.&rdquo; Littr&eacute; gives the
derivation of the word; he says it is from the Gothic <i>Vaipa</i>, or German
<i>Weban</i> or <i>Weben</i> (<i>g</i> and <i>p</i> replacing the <i>w</i> and <i>b</i>).</p>

The word lace came from France, where it was called <i>lacis</i> or <i>lassis</i>,
derived from the Latin <i>laqueus</i> (a noose). These words originally
applied to narrow ribbons&mdash;their use being to lace or tie.</p>

The Venetians early made much lace for furniture or ecclesiastical
linen adornment, of what they called &ldquo;maglia quadrata,&rdquo; which was
usually squared netting, afterwards filled in with patterns in darned
needlework. This somewhat primitive style of lace trimming was
popular on account of its simplicity, and descended to the peasantry
for their domestic decorations in Spain, Germany, France, and Italy.
There are specimens of this work believed to be of the thirteenth
century. At the time of the Renaissance the simple geometrical designs
developed into animals, fruits, flowers, and human figures.</p>

The first lace-making machine was contemporary, or nearly so, with
the stocking-making frame. About the year 1768 it was altered, and
adapted for making open-work patterns. In 1808, the Heathcot machine
was started for bobbin net. In 1813, John Leaver improved on this
idea, with machine-woven patterns. The Jacquard apparatus achieved
the flat patterns, and the new &ldquo;Dentelli&egrave;re&rdquo; has perfected the art.

I am assured on the best authority that this is unknown as yet at
Burano; but the workers, as well as the revived industry, are very
young. The modern school of Burano has only been established
eleven years. It is certainly delightful to see the 320 happy faces,
singing, chattering, and smiling over their graceful occupation; and the
beauty of the Buranese women, which is celebrated, has not suffered
from their occupation. There is a charming little article of the <i>Revista di
Torino</i>, 1883, which describes the improvement in the social condition
of Burano, morally and physically, and the way it is recognized by the
inhabitants. Instead of signs of miserable poverty, the promoters of
the lace school are greeted by the women leaning from the windows
with, &ldquo;Siestu benedetta!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Be thou blessed!&rdquo;).</p>

Minerva accepts the challenge of the M&aelig;onian Arachne, who will
not yield to her in the praises of being first in weaving wool. The girls
desert the vineyards round the little town of Hyp&aelig;pa, to look at her
admirable workmanship. She boasts that hers is finer than that of
Pallas, and, desiring a vain victory, rushes upon her own destruction.
&ldquo;... They stretch out two webs on the loom, with a fine warp. The web
is tied to the beam; the slay separates the warp; the woof is inserted in
the middle with sharp shuttles, while the fingers hurry along, and being
drawn with the warp, the teeth (notched in the moving slay) strike it.
Both hasten on their labour, and girding up their garments to their
bosoms, they move their skilful arms, their eagerness beguiling their
fatigue. There are being woven both the purples, which are subjected to
the Tyrian brazen (dyeing) vessel with fine shades of minute difference;
as in the rainbow with its mighty rays reflected by the shower, where,
though a thousand colours are shining, yet the very transition eludes
the eyes that look upon it; to such a degree is that which is adjacent
the same, and yet the extremes are different. The pliant gold is mingled
with the threads, and ancient subjects are represented on the webs.&rdquo;
Then follows the list of the subjects. The web of Pallas had a large
central design, and a smaller one on each corner, surrounded with a
border of olive leaves. Arachne&rsquo;s contained nineteen pictures, of two
or more figures each, and was surrounded by a border of flowers, interwoven
with the twining ivy. Ovid&rsquo;s &ldquo;Metamorphoses,&rdquo; book vi.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of my friend, Lord Houghton, I am enabled
to give the sequel of the story&mdash;Arachne&rsquo;s transformation into the
Spider, as&mdash;</p>

Guicciardini ascribes the invention of woven tapestry to Arras,
giving no dates; so we do not know whether he attributes it to the
Belgic Atrebates or to their successors, the Franks. In either case the
craft was probably imported from the East.</p>

The Atrebates were the inhabitants of that Belgic region till the fifth
century; now it is the province of Artois, probably a corruption of the
name &ldquo;Atrebates.&rdquo; Taylor, &ldquo;Words and Places&rdquo; (1865), pp. 229-385.</p>

The commentators of Vasari, MM. Lechanch&eacute; and Jenron, believe
that this art was coeval in the Low Countries with Roman civilization
and Christianity; but it would appear that the weavers had fled to
Britain to escape from the Romans. Ibid. p. 52. Traces of the name
Arras have been found by Bochart and Frahn in Ar-ras, the Arabian
name for the river Araxes and the people who inhabit its shores; but
this may be accidental, and is at best an uncertain derivation.</p>

Rock, Introduction, p. cxii. This &ldquo;Saracenic work&rdquo; is really so like
what is called by the Germans &ldquo;Gobelins&rdquo; when found in Egyptian
tombs that one can hardly doubt whence the Moors brought their art.
There are several Egyptian specimens in the British Museum. See
also the catalogue of Herr Graf&rsquo;schen&rsquo;s collection of Egyptian textiles,

also M. Jubinal, &ldquo;Tapisserie Historique.&rdquo; It is difficult absolutely to
assign to any known specimens a date anterior to the fifteenth century;
although M. de Champeaux thinks that the &ldquo;Sarazinois&rdquo; were mostly or
entirely carpet-weavers about the eleventh century. He says there is documentary
authority to prove that these were woven with flowers and
animals. There is a very deep-piled velvety carpet at Gorhambury
(the Earl of Verulam&rsquo;s place). Here Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s arms and cypher
appear on a Persian or Moresque ground pattern surrounded with a
wreath of oak leaves. It may have been a gift from Spain,&mdash;left
after one of her visits to her Chancellor.</p>

&ldquo;Tapisseries des Gobelins,&rdquo; A. L. Lacordaire, p. 10 (1853). He
considers that the Sarazinois were embroiderers as well as weavers&mdash;and
this theory is supported by extracts from an inventory of Charles VI.&rsquo;s
hangings of 1421.</p>

<p>Every detail of the art and its materials was carefully regulated by the
French statutes of 1625-27, containing many laws for the perfecting of
the manufacture of new as well as the restoration of old tapestries&mdash;and
fines were imposed for not using materials as nearly as possible matching
the original ones; and likewise for any other dereliction from the
rules of the craft. Ibid. pp. 9, 10, 14.</p>

At the Poldi Bezzoli Museum in Milan there are some very fine
carpets; one especially, a Persian, is supposed to be of the fifteenth
century. This is very finely woven of pure, tender colours, and the
whole composition, flowers and animals (most beautifully drawn lions,
&amp;c.), is delicately outlined in black on a white ground. The colouring
is rich and harmonious, and has the iridescent effect of mother of pearl.</p>

There is much splendid tapestry&mdash;German, and especially Bavarian,&mdash;to
be seen at Munich; and, indeed, the more one seeks, the more
one finds that private looms were constantly at work in the Middle
Ages for votive offerings. There is a tapestry altar-piece at Coire,
in the Grisons, of the Crucifixion, which is evidently of the fourteenth
century. The colours are still brilliant, and the whole background
is beautifully composed of growing flowers. No sky is seen.
There is at Munich an altar frontal of tapestry, Gothic of the fifteenth
century, exquisitely beautiful. The weaver has introduced a little portrait
of herself at her loom, under the folds of the virgin&rsquo;s cloak at her feet.</p>

M. Albert Castel (&ldquo;Tapisserie,&rdquo; p. 53) believes that the taking of Constantinople,
when Earl Baldwin was elected to the throne of Byzantium,
had a great effect on Flemish art, which then received a strong impulse
from Oriental designs and traditions. See M. Jubinal&rsquo;s very interesting
account of the tapisserie de Nancy which lined the tents of Charles the
Bold at the siege of Nancy (p. 439). These tapestries are an allegory
against gluttony. &ldquo;Tapisseries Hist.,&rdquo; pp. 1-5.</p>

Charles the Bold has left us records of his taste in tent hangings of
Arras at Berne, as well as at Nancy. These are the plunder from his
camp equipage after the battle of Grandson. The whole suite, of
many pieces, represents battles and sieges, and sacred subjects also,
such as the adoration of the Magi. They are finely drawn and splendidly
executed with gold lights, and are of the most perfect style of the
fifteenth century. The National Museum at Munich contains most
valuable specimens of very early and very fine tapestries; amongst
others, a Virgin, which was certainly designed in the school of D&uuml;rer,
and is of the greatest perfection of its art, both as to colour and
drawing and the general effect, which has a soft, dreamy beauty, only
to be seen in fine woollen tapestries, and differing from pictorial design
and intention.</p>

M. de Champeaux, the author of the &ldquo;Handbook of Art Tapestry&rdquo;
belonging to the series of the Kensington Museum, 1878, says that the
history of Arras has yet to be written. He, however, gives a great deal
of interesting information, especially about the French tapestries,
on which subject we fancy there is little more to tell. Their art does
not come from such a distant time as that of the Belgian manufactures.
After Louis IX. had decimated the inhabitants, and dispersed the
remainder, Arras yet made a gallant struggle to revive her industry and
compete with the rising prosperity of Brussels; but France had decreed
against her.</p>

Piers, Earl of Ormonde, married the daughter of Fitzgerald, Earl of
Kildare, &ldquo;a person of great wisdom and courage.&rdquo; They brought from
Flanders and the neighbouring provinces artificers and manufacturers,
whom they employed at Kilkenny in working tapestries, diaper, Turkey

William Sheldon at his own expense brought workmen from
Flanders, and employed them in weaving maps of the different
counties of England. Of these, three large maps, the earliest
specimens, were purchased by the Earl of Orford (Horace Walpole), by
whom they were given to Earl Harcourt. He had them repaired and
cleaned, and made as fresh as when out of the loom, and eventually
gave them to Gough, the antiquary, who bequeathed them to the
University of Oxford. The Armada tapestry, which is stated to have
been designed by Henry Cornelius Vroom, the Dutch marine painter,
and woven by Francis Spiering, appears to have been, in 1602, in the
possession of Lord Howard, Lord High Admiral and the hero of the
Armada. Fuller particulars are given in Walpole&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anecdotes,&rdquo; i. p.
246, under the name of Vroom, Sandart being the principal authority.
Part of them were in the House of Lords till 1834, when they perished
in the fire. These had been engraved in 1739 by John Pine, but it
appears that at that time there were in the royal wardrobe other pieces,
now lost.</p>

There is in Brydges&rsquo; &ldquo;Northamptonshire,&rdquo; under the head of
&ldquo;Stoke Bruere&rdquo; (the estate which King James gave to Sir F. Crane as
part payment of the deficit of &pound;16,400 in his tapestry business), mention
of the cartoons of &ldquo;Raphael of Urbin, ... had from Genoa,&rdquo; and their
cost, &pound;300, besides the transport. M. Blanc says, with great justness,
that Raphael, when he prepared these cartoons for tapestry, made
designs for weaving, and <em>did not paint pictures</em>. If they had been intended
for oil pictures, they would have been very differently treated.</p>

It has been at different periods the crowning glory of the craft of
the weaver to place different patterns or pictures on the two sides of the
web. This would almost appear to be impossible, but that it has been
done in late years, according to Rock, who tells us that he saw a banner
so woven, with the Austrian eagle on one side and the Virgin of the
Immaculate Conception on the other. He says that the same manufacturer
was then being employed in producing ecclesiastical garments
with the colours and patterns so varied.</p>

In old tapestries three tints only were employed for the complexions
of men, women, and children&mdash;the man&rsquo;s reddish, the woman&rsquo;s yellow,
and the child&rsquo;s whiter than either. It is an agreeable economy of
colours, simple and effective, and avoids the pictorial imitation that one
deprecates. See M. Charles Blanc&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grammaire des Arts D&eacute;coratifs:

</div>


<p>The most important works that have been executed
in embroidery, have been hangings or carpets. We may
look upon these as belonging to the history of the past.
Never again will such works be undertaken. Their
<i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>, as well as the means for their production,
have ceased to exist. We have very ancient historical
evidence of the use of hangings (or tapestries), either as
curtains to exclude prying eyes, or as coverings to what
was sacred or else unseemly, or as ornamental backgrounds
in public and private buildings.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that in pillared spaces the enclosures
and subdivisions were completed by hangings from
pillar to pillar, from the earliest times of Asiatic civilization.
In Assyria, and afterwards in Greece and Rome,
the open courts and rooms were shaded from the sun and
rain by umbrella-like erections with hangings stretched
over them. From the Coliseum&rsquo;s vast area to that of the
smallest atrium in the Pompeian house, the covering
principle was the same.</p>

<p>Palace-halls and temples alike were furnished in this
way, and the cold splendour of the polished marbles
was enhanced by contrast with the shadowing folds of soft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
textures richly embroidered in bright colours and gold.
The statues, the gold and silver vessels, the shrines
heaped with votive offerings, were all brought into higher
relief and effect by the screens, the curtains, and the veils
which classical perfect taste would plan so as to carry
out the decorator&rsquo;s intention. Babylonians, Persians,
Assyrians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Jews, each adorned
their sacred places in similar fashions.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Clemens
Alexandrinus says that behind the hangings of the
Egyptian temples were hidden their &ldquo;foolish images.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>The word &ldquo;hangings&rdquo; was applied to all large curtains
and tapestries, tent coverings, screens dividing empty
spaces, or pendant between pillars; also sails,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> banners, and
decorations for processional purposes covering walls or
hanging from windows; all these have been embroidered
or woven with pictures and patterns. Carpets, from
having originally the same name, &ldquo;tapete,&rdquo; are to be
added to this list, and, in fact, their uses are often
interchanged. Kosroes&rsquo; famous hangings were used as a
carpet, and Persian and Babylonian carpets have been
hung on the walls. A Babylonian hanging must have
resembled, in its style (of which we have descriptions),
the Persian carpet of to-day.</p>

<p>Semper gives excellent reasons for his theory that,
next to dress, hangings (the clothing of architecture)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
were the earliest phase of art.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> He looks upon the most
ancient paintings on architecture as absolutely representing
textile coverings. Some of the earliest Babylonian
decorations show men supporting draperies, which he
believes to be the tradition of the time when the tallest
slaves held up the hangings to their own height; and
above them, in tiers, were men, dwarfs, and even
children fastened on brackets, carrying the hangings up
to the roofs. This was an Assyrian custom, and was
adopted by the Romans as a mode of disposing of their
prisoners of war. Woltmann and Woermann appear to
lean to the suggestion that permanent imitations of
hangings were carried out in painted or encaustic tiles
covering the masonry of Chaldean buildings at Nimroud
and Khorsabad. The pale ones associated with low reliefs,
and really resembling them, as they were partly raised,
and the reliefs in alabaster and stone, which were partly
coloured, were in harmony, and yet in contrast, with the
brilliant tiles of Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>We know exactly what were the purple, scarlet, and
white hangings of the Sanctuary in the wilderness,
designed by Bezaleel, and that the veil of the Temple
was blue, purple, crimson or scarlet, and white, i.e.
worked on white linen; and we know from Josephus,
that &ldquo;the veil of the Temple, which was rent in twain&rdquo;
sixteen centuries later, was that dedicated by Herod,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
and was Babylonian work, representing heaven and
earth<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> (see p. <a href="#Page_23">23</a> <i>ante</i>). Its colouring was scarlet, white,
and blue. Scarlet and white hangings seem indeed to
have been an Oriental fashion; and fashion then was
not ephemeral, but lasted hundreds of years. The
embroidered curtains of the Tabernacle are repeated in
the hangings of Alexander&rsquo;s wedding tent, after 1500
years; and a thousand years later still they reappear in
the seventh century, when Pope Sergius gave curtains
to the high altar (baldachino) in the basilica of St. Peter&rsquo;s
at Rome of this same scarlet and white embroidery.</p>

<p>In early Oriental art, the enormous expenditure of
work is appalling to think of. Abulfeda describes the
palace of the Caliph Moctader, on the banks of the Tigris,
as being adorned with 38,000 pieces of tapestry, and of
these 12,000 were of silk worked in gold. What a wealth
of women had to be wasted in creating such a wealth
of embroideries!<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>There is a Bedouin romance which describes the tent
of Antar, and shows the taste for large works. Five
thousand horsemen could skirmish under its embroidered
shade; and Akbar&rsquo;s largest tent held 10,000 persons.</p>

<p>Nadir Shah&rsquo;s gorgeous tent, which was of the end of
the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth
century, was of scarlet cloth on the outside, lined with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
violet satin embroidered with gold and precious stones.
The peacock throne was placed within it, and was kept
there during the remainder of Nadir Shah&rsquo;s reign.</p>

<p>Sir John Chardin says that &ldquo;The Khan of Persia
caused a tent to be made which cost two millions:
they called it the house of gold;&rdquo; and it was resplendent
with embroideries.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> These are comparatively modern
works, and sound commonplace and vulgar compared to
those of Greece and Egypt.</p>

<p>The Greeks imitated the tents and temporary buildings
of the Eastern monarchs. This phase of Oriental luxury
was imported by Alexander the Great, and we have the
description of two of his gorgeous creations at Alexandria,
where he outrivalled the ancient traditional glories of
Assyria and Persia. His own tent was supported by
fifty golden pillars, carrying a roof of woven gold, embroidered
in shimmering colours, and divided from the
surrounding court, filled with guards and retainers, by
scarlet and white curtains of splendid material and
design.</p>

<p>But more gorgeous is the account of the tent in which
he entertained ninety-one of his companions-in-arms on
the occasion of his marriage. This tent was supported
by columns twenty cubits high, plated with silver and
gold, and inlaid with precious stones. The walls of the
court were formed by curtains adorned with figures
worked in gold, and were hung from beams plated with
the precious metals, to match the columns. The outer
court was half a mile in circumference.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>Yet Alexander&rsquo;s wedding-tent was exceeded in splendour
by that erected by Ptolemy Philadelphus for his great
pomp at Alexandria, described by Kallixenos, as cited by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
Athen&aelig;us.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> This tent, crowned with golden eagles, was
supported by pillars fifty cubits high. They upheld an
architrave with cross-beams covered with linen, on which
were painted coffers, to imitate the structure of a solid
roof. From the centre was suspended a veil of scarlet
bordered with white. The pillars in the four angles represented
palm-trees of gold, and the intermediate columns
were fashioned as thursi, and were probably wreathed
with golden vines and bunches of grapes made of
amethysts, as we know of a Persian tent so adorned,
and the whole idea of the erection was evidently fresh
from the East.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> A frieze eight cubits high was composed
of niches containing groups of tragic, comic, and
Satyric figures &ldquo;in their natural garb;&rdquo; and nymphs and
golden tripods from Delphi. The tent was separated
from the outer peristyle by scarlet hangings, covered
with choice skins of wild beasts. Upon these were hung
the celebrated Sikyonian pictures, the heritage of the
Ptolemaic dynasty, alternating with portraits and rich
hangings, on which were embroidered the likenesses of
kings, and likewise mythological subjects. Between
these and the frieze hung gold and silver shields.
Opposite the entrance, vessels of the most costly materials
and workmanship, valued at 10,000 talents of silver, were
ranged, so as to strike the eye of all who entered there.
Golden couches supported by Sphinxes were placed
along the sides of the tent, furnished with soft purple
woollen mattresses, and coverings gaily and exquisitely
embroidered. The floor was strewn with fresh blossoms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
except where a most costly Persian carpet covered the
centre. In the doorways and against the pillars stood a
hundred precious statues by the greatest artists.</p>

<p>This description dazzles the imagination! To be an
upholsterer (a vestiarius) in those days was to be an
engineer, architect, and artist! Semper, from whose
translation we are quoting, remarks that the luxurious
&ldquo;motive&rdquo; of such an erection naturally arose from the
desire to make use of the mass of artistic materials
acquired by conquest, and the effort to reduce them to
certain architectural principles already accepted.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>That Alexander did not purposely destroy the Persian
embroideries is evident from the fact that Lucullus
speaks of them 200 years later.</p>

<p>Rome accepted and adopted all the Oriental uses of
hangings, in the Temple and the house for temporary
festive occasions.</p>

<p>By both Greeks and Romans hangings were used in
triumphal processions, covering immense moving cars
or draping the temporary buildings which lined the
avenues of their progress. Also the funeral pyres which
Greece and Rome copied from Assyria were hung with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
splendid materials and embroideries. Without describing
one of these awful erections, it is impossible to give
any idea of how much artistic treasure was thrown
into the flames which consumed the remains of a great
man. The funeral pyre dedicated by Alexander to his
friend Heph&aelig;stion recalls that erected by Sardanapalus
in one of the courts of his own palace, on which he
perished, surrounded by his wives and his treasures.
Heph&aelig;stion&rsquo;s catafalque was built of inflammable materials,
250 feet high, raised in many stories, and hung
with pictorial tapestries, painted and embroidered. Each
story was adorned with images of ivory and gold. In
the upper story were enormous hollow figures of Sirens,
filled with singers, who chanted the funeral odes.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> It
is to be hoped that they were released before the
conflagration.</p>

<p>The records of such extravagant funeral ceremonies
teach us how much of human thought, how much of
art and beauty which had helped to civilize the world,
were torn from the places they were intelligently designed
to decorate, heaped up by the conquerors, and
as ruthlessly spent and destroyed for the boast of a day.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Christian Rome adopted the traditions of Pagan
decoration, and introduced them in her worship, processions,
and shows. A great religious procession like
that of the &ldquo;Corpus Domini&rdquo; in our own times, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
reminded us of a Roman triumph. The baldachini
and the banners; the torches; the streets, festooned
with draperies; even the Pagan emblems, which have
been converted into Christian symbolism&mdash;all these
were the echoes of classical days; but they are fast disappearing.
Two thousand years will have worn out
and effaced these customs, and our children will not see
them.</p>

<p>I have not space to linger over the many descriptions of
Oriental, Grecian, and Roman work to be gathered from
classical authors, but from them this lesson is to be learned
that the first principle which guided those great decorators
was the individuality and appropriateness of each design
to the purpose for which it was intended and the place
it was to fill. But even their peculiar excellences did
not save them from the universal law of destruction.
When the hangings were worn, or became for any reason
distasteful, they were replaced by others, often by gifts
or spoils from friendly allies or conquered kings. The
quantity of gold laid upon these great religious or
national works was the cause of their destruction as soon
as they were withdrawn and superseded by something of
a newer fashion. The intrinsic value in precious metals
of such works is proved by Pliny&rsquo;s statement that Nero
gave four millions of sesterces for covers of couches
in a banqueting-hall.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> The hangings or carpets
taken by the Caliph Omar from Kosroes&rsquo; white palace
(<small>A.D.</small> 651) must have been some of the finest and most
valuable embroideries ever known. They formed a
tapestry carpet or hanging, representing all the flowers
of spring, worked in coloured silks, gold, and precious
stones. Kosroes entreated Omar to keep it intact for
himself, but he was so virtuous that he cut it up into
little bits and divided it amongst his generals. Gibbon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
describes this wonderful piece of work.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> We have heard
much of a marvellous carpet, given lately by the Guicowar
of Baroda to the tomb of Mahomet at Medina, which,
from its description, recalls the style of Kosroes&rsquo; hangings;
and their history gives us a notable instance of
how works of art in the time of war and conquest come
to be considered only for the value of their materials.
War, the enemy of culture, all but effaces whole phases
of art when a country is overrun and plundered. But
there is almost always a residuum, which has influence
whenever there is a revival, beginning with the smaller
arts of luxury in more peaceful and prosperous days.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>To return to the classical veils and hangings. You
may see them on Babylonian bas-reliefs, on Greek fictile
vases, or painted in frescoes on the walls of Egyptian
tombs and temples; in the houses in Pompeii and Herculaneum,
and in the remains of Roman villas and tombs
everywhere. From all of these we may learn something.</p>

<p>The obvious intention of hangings in household decoration
is to cover bare walls, so as to adorn at once that
which was rough or common, without delay or trouble.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
They were also used as curtains to shut out the cold or
the heat, and to give privacy to rooms without doors or
windows. Hangings on bare walls have always been
meant to hang straight down, undisturbed by folds,
whereas curtains and porti&egrave;res would probably have to
be looped up or continually drawn aside. The designs
to be worked upon them should necessarily be regulated
by their shape and use.</p>

<p>Semper considers that a square is an expressionless form,
and that it should be avoided.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> If you wish to give dignity
to a room, its hanging decorations should be divided into
panels of greater height than breadth, so as to elevate the
spaces they cover. Horizontal stripes bring down the
ceiling, and even in furniture, look ill except as borders.
Nothing can be more ugly or inartistic than the curtains
one finds in old illuminations, covered with bands of the
same pattern throughout the surface, but even this is less
unpleasant on the walls than lines crossing each other
at right angles. The Romans looked on chequers as
barbarous national characteristics, and left them to the
Gauls and Britons. Chequers should be avoided unless
they express a meaning, as in Scotch tartans. Semper
observes that the striped stuffs, especially those of
Oriental fabrics, were never intended to be spread out
flat, but to be draped in folds and loops, and the lines
only seen broken up. He continues:&mdash;&ldquo;One rule,
which cannot be neglected with impunity, is this: that
whether the hanging or screen is supposed to stand
or to hang, there must be an above and a below to
every pattern, and it must, moreover, be upright.&rdquo; All
foliage designs, and those containing animals, must start
from below, and grow upwards. Another of his laws is
that the heaviest colours should be placed below, and the
palest and brightest above. This may be disputed. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
must be first determined where contrast is needed. If the
darkest part of the pattern is below, it may be necessary
to give it the lightest background, on the principle of
balancing quantities in colour. The dado, or lowest
border, will often give the necessary weight to the design.
Semper goes on to say, &ldquo;A surface may be made to
appear to stand, or to hang down, according to its
decoration. For instance, a triangle will hang or stand,
according as its apex points downwards or upwards.
But in draped curtains all symmetry of design is lost,
and the rich forms and fulness of folds rather tend to
destroy the effect of elaborate patterns, and to take their
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another important difference between standing and
hanging tapestries is their finish or edge, the upper one
being an upright continuous border, and the lower one a
fringe. In both cases it is a continuation of the main
threads of the material, and these belong exclusively to the
hanging tapestries and curtains. The fringe is so essential
a part of hanging decoration, that we must pause and give
it our best consideration. In Babylonian art it is most
important. The extreme solidity of the knotted fringes
in their dress and hangings show either the thickness of
the woven substance, or that the fringes were made by
enriching the warp and adding to it. They are almost
always, on the Assyrian sculptures, simply knotted
fringes; but the little portable Chaldean temple on the
bronze gates from Balawat (near Nimroud), in the British
Museum, shows fringes of bells or fruit like those of the
Jewish tabernacle in the wilderness (fig. <a href="#fig02">2</a>). On Egyptian
linen we sometimes see, woven or worked, a reticulated
pattern which imitates a fringe.</p>

<p>The carpets of the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Persians
were evidently used sometimes as hangings, though
many of their designs would not have served both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
purposes equally well. That the Babylonian weavers,
however, understood that a carpet lying on the ground
should be covered with an even pattern, and be finished
with a border all round, is evident from the exquisitely
chiselled designs, imitating carpets, on two portions of pavements
in the British Museum (pl. <a href="#pl27">27</a>); and we may compare
these with the different treatment of designs for the veils
of the temples, both in Babylon and Egypt, on which
were represented the signs of the zodiac and all the
heavenly bodies, and other symbolical and unconventional
forms. The Atrium of the Greek and Pompeian houses,
which was modelled on the same idea, was separated
from the Court by curtains, hung on rods or nails. On
festive occasions these may have been garlanded with
natural flowers. If so, we may be sure that the little wreaths
worked on them, as we learn from frescoes, would combine
with the gala day&rsquo;s decorations, and would be designed with
that view. The Greek artist would never have approved
of natural flowers or trees, embroidered as if growing
out of a dado, simulating a garden worked in wool. This
would have been considered a bad attempt at pictorial art.</p>

<p>M. Louis de Ronchaud, in his &ldquo;Tapisseries des
Anciens,&rdquo; speaks of the hangings which he supposes to
have decked the recess that contained the chryselephantine
statue of Athen&egrave; Parthenos in her temple at Athens.
He says these votive hangings dressed the pillars that
surrounded the Hecatompedon, and formed a tent over
the head of the goddess. M. de Ronchaud believes
that among the subjects of the Delphic embroideries,
described by Euripides in the tragedy of Ion, may be
recognized some derived from the designs on saffron-coloured
hangings, spoken of by the poet as &ldquo;the wings
of the peplos.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

The downfall of decorative art, domestic as well as
national, kept pace with the downfall of the Roman
Empire. During the Dark Ages, of such art there seems
to have been very little; and of that the best was Celtic
or Anglo-Saxon. But the darkness shrouds from our
view the artistic life of the world, and the dawn was
very long in breaking. We must therefore return to the
subject of hangings, after a gap of nearly a thousand
years, when the first stirrings of the European revival
came, in the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Symonds says: &ldquo;The arts
and the inventions, the knowledge and the books, which
suddenly became vital at the time of the Renaissance,
had long lain neglected on the shores of that Dead Sea
which we call &lsquo;The Middle Ages.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that, during the Dark Ages,
hangings woven and embroidered continued to be the
custom throughout Europe. Our own Anglo-Saxon
records prove that such furnishings were employed to
mitigate the cold bareness of our northern homes from
the earliest times. Sir G. Dasent informs me that in
Icelandic Sagas, as early as the eleventh century, there
are frequent notices of hangings both in churches and
in the halls of houses; such, for instance, as the Saga
of Charlemagne, i.e. scenes out of Charlemagne&rsquo;s life,
worked on hangings 20 ells long. In Scaldic poetry, a
periphrasis for a &ldquo;lady&rdquo; is &ldquo;the ground of hangings,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the bridge of hangings,&rdquo; all pointing to embroidery.</p>

<p>From illuminated MSS. engraved in Strutt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Antiquities
of the English,&rdquo; and contemporary European
work of the tenth to the thirteenth centuries, we find that
the favourite style of embroidery, when not representing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
historical or sacred subjects, was a <i>parsem&eacute;</i> pattern.
Armorial bearings were generally reserved for cushions,
chair-backs, and the baldachinos of altars, beds, and
thrones.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Richer and more flowing designs were later
introduced.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries,
splendid tapestries of Arras, and hangings even of cloth
of gold, were common as palatial decorations. Sometimes
we have a glimpse of less ambitious hangings; for
instance, in the London house of Sir Andrew Larkynge,
Knight, in the fifteenth century, the hall was hung
with sage-green panels, bordered with gold &ldquo;darned
work,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;parler&rdquo; with sage-green, bordered with
crimson.</p>

<p>French embroidered hangings were very fine in the
sixteenth century. Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret, the mother of Henri
IV., was a great patroness of such works. Miss Freer
tells us that&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Jeanne and Antoine took possession of the
Castle of Pau, they found their new abode rich in
works of art and splendid decorations. The refined taste
of Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me was visible everywhere.
Jeanne&rsquo;s presence-chamber was adorned with hangings
of crimson satin, embroidered by the hand of Marguerite
herself. The embroidery represented a passage from
the history of the Queen&rsquo;s own life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the hours which the Queen allowed herself
for relaxation, she worked tapestry, and discoursed with
some one of the learned men whom she protected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen daily attended the afternoon sermon,
preached by her chaplains in rotation. Often, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
weary with the excess of her mental labours, and lulled
by the drowsy intonation of some of these ministers,
the Queen slept during part of the discourse. Jeanne
always felt severe reproach of conscience when she
had thus involuntarily yielded to fatigue; and finding the
inclination grow upon her, she demanded permission
from the Synod to work tapestry during the sermon.
This request was granted; and from thenceforth, Queen
Jeanne, bending decorously over her tapestry-frame, and
busy with her needle, gave due attention to the rambling
addresses of her preachers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comme elle (Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret) estoit grandement
adonn&eacute;e aux devises, elle fit de sa main de belles et
grandes tapisseries, entre lesquelles il y a une tente de
douze ou quinze pi&egrave;ces excellente qui s&rsquo;appelle <i>les Prisons
bris&eacute;es</i>, par lesquelles elle donnoit &agrave; conn&ocirc;istre qu&rsquo;elle avoit
bris&eacute; les liens et secou&eacute; le joug de la captivit&eacute; du Pape.
Au milieu de chaque pi&egrave;ce, il y a une histoire du Vieu
Testament qui resent la libert&eacute;, comme la d&eacute;livrance de
Suzanne, la sortie du peuple de la captivit&eacute; d&rsquo;Egypte,
l&rsquo;&eacute;largissement de Joseph. Et &agrave; tous les coins il y a des
chaisnes rompues, des menottes bris&eacute;es, des strapades et
des gibbets en pi&egrave;ces, et par-dessus en grosses lettres ce
sont ces paroles de la deuxi&egrave;me aux Corinthiens, ch. iii.:
<i>Ubi spiritus, ibi libertas.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>Cluny boasts a most curious suite of hangings from the
Chateau de Boussac, of the early part of the fifteenth
century, which are charming, quaint, and gay, and
historically and arch&aelig;ologically interesting. They tell
the story of the &ldquo;Dame au Lion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Modern French tapestries, from the manufactories of
the Savonnerie, the Gobelins, and elsewhere, are decorative
to the highest degree. Nothing can be more festive than
these works of the time of Louis XIII., XIV., and XV.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
framed in white and gold, carved wood, or stucco, reflected
in mirrors, and lighted by crystal or glass chandeliers
and girandoles. Such hangings have nothing in
common with those of early times; they are not temporary
coverings of bare spaces, but panels in decorated walls,
where they form an integral part of the architectural
composition and design. They do not merely serve
to give warmth, comfort, and colour to desolate halls,
as did those ancient tapestries belonging to the furniture
of the great man who sent them on before
him from palace to palace, carrying them away with
his baggage lest some one else should do so in his
absence. These were probably merely attached by loops
and nails, as one sees in country villas or castles in Italy
to this day.</p>

<p>We find that the Italians in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries often hung their walls with upright
strips of work, in the guise of pilasters. The walls
were thus divided into panelled spaces, which separated
pictures, statues, and cabinets, of which the style did not
agree in juxtaposition. These pilasters were generally of
&ldquo;opus consutum,&rdquo; or &ldquo;appliqu&eacute;&rdquo; in its different forms.
Above, next to the cornice, and below, next to the dado,
or even touching the floor, they were connected by
borders of similar work. The spaces between were
mostly filled in with rich brocades or velvets of one
colour, so as to make the best backgrounds for the artistic
treasures grouped against them. Sometimes fine tapestries
filled the intervening spaces, and sometimes splendid
embroideries. There is a beautiful example of this sort of
decoration at Holland House, where the dining-room is
adorned with pilasters worked on velvet in gold and
coloured silks, with tapestries between them. This is
Florentine work, of the sixteenth or beginning of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
Hangings entirely in needlework, to cover large spaces,
are rare, but a few are to be found all over Europe in
museums, palaces, and private houses, which are interesting
as objects of art. The genealogical tree of the
Counts of Kyburg, designed in the sixteenth century,
and carried to France as plunder, and now restored to
its home near Zurich, is a remarkable instance of a piece
of needlework that deserved the value placed on it.
Many splendid pieces of embroidered tapestries are at
the Cluny Museum. The beatitudes of St. Catherine,
from the castle at Tarrascon, and the hangings worked
in appliqu&eacute; and flat stitches with portraits of Henri IV.,
Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret, &amp;c., are monuments of industry, and
design; and are very beautiful.</p>

<p>There, is a large room at Castle Ashby hung with
tapestry in cross stitches, worked by the ladies of the
family, and finished 150 years ago. The industry shown
here is indubitable, but the designs are barbarously bad
and funny. In the Palazzo Giustini at Florence there is
a suite of hangings worked also in cross stitches of the
same period, of which the design is very clever and
graceful, and the effect beautiful and artistic. An irregular
bank of brown earth is crowded with grasses and small
flowers about a foot above the dado, and from this grow
rose-bushes, covered with blossoms of different shades,
held back to a treillage of delicate &ldquo;cane colours.&rdquo; The
leafage is brown, against a sky that is not blue, but
which rather reminds one of blue than of grey. It is
conventionally treated, and the effect is singularly rich
and harmonious. Had it been a little more naturalistic,
it would have looked too much like a painted picture;
but as it is, the decoration is charming, and so universally
admired that we cannot but wonder it has never been
imitated. In the Borghese Palace at Rome there is a
ball-room hung with white satin embroidered with wreaths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
of flowers, and a similar one in the Caetani Palace, on
crimson satin. These are about 150 years old, and are
so far above being mere objects of fashion, that they must
be placed by their beauty of design and execution amongst
objects of art, and so will probably survive more centuries
of change, holding their own, and increasing in value and
esteem.</p>

<p>For hangings in church decoration, the reader is
referred to the chapters on ecclesiastical art and on
tapestry.</p>

<p>Having discussed the origin and reason for hangings,
and having tried to draw from what has been accepted as
beautiful and perfect in taste, some guidance in hanging
our modern rooms, supposing always that the spaces are
fitted for really fine decorations, I yet would add a
few more words on this subject. There are in general
some previous conditions which will help us to choose the
style and design of such furnishings. In the first place,
we should study what is appropriate to the persons who
will first inhabit the rooms. The bride&rsquo;s apartment may be
white and gold, garlanded with roses, and gay with groups
of Cupids; but such prettinesses would not be suitable to
the home of a mourning Queen. Tender or subdued
colouring equally sets off groups of young and lovely
faces, and the bent form robed in black. Embroideries
are always agreeable on such backgrounds, and it is as
a vehicle for needlework that I now allude to the
design of the artist in hangings. We are somewhat
restricted, or we ought to be, when there are treasures
of art already in the house, by the desire to exhibit
them to the best advantage. The hangings should be
of a colour which suits all pictures, and if the walls are
either embroidered or tapestried with woven designs,
they should be very much subdued, both in form and
colour, so as not to prevent the eye from perceiving at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
once the precious objects hung against them. A fine
brocade or velvet of one colour suits pictures best; but
if our object is to show off our cabinets, which are
generally black, and our statues, which are mostly white,
then richly embroidered backgrounds in brilliant colours
are the best, compensating the eye in variety and
splendour.</p>

The figure-painting of the nations we have spoken of, successful
so far as it concerns its special purpose of exhibiting a clear and
comprehensive chronicle of events, is at the same time no more, so
far as it concerns its artistic effect, than a piece of tapestry or embroidery
done into stone, and can only be estimated ... as a piece of
coloured wall decoration. Woltmann and Woermann, &ldquo;History of

When one is moved to pity, thinking of the enforced labour of thousands
of captive women, fallen, perhaps, from high estate, and only valued for
the toil of their hands, it comforts one to believe that they would hardly
have produced beautiful works without enjoying some happiness in the
creation of that beauty.</p>

The art of the &ldquo;tapezziere,&rdquo; &ldquo;tapissier,&rdquo; &ldquo;tapestry-hanger,&rdquo; is
not a recognized one with us, though it is in Italy and France, where
the hangings for special occasions in churches and houses are stored
away, treasured for hundreds of years, cleaned and mended, and hung
and placed to the best advantage by men educated for the purpose.
In poor churches which possess no fine materials for decoration, one
has often wondered at and admired the picturesque effects extracted
from yards of muslin, gold tinsel, and box wreaths, artistically combined.
Our house carpenter is the only representative we have of the vestiarius,
and he is but a feeble descendant from the ancestors of his craft, who
were expected to study and evolve the adornments of the building for
its completion, the materials of decoration for special occasions, and
lastly, the mechanical means for hanging and stretching the draperies.
These were sometimes movable frames or posts&mdash;&ldquo;scabella&rdquo; (whence
&ldquo;escabeau,&rdquo; &eacute;chafaudage, scaffolding).</p>

Never again will such great works be executed with the needle.
In civilized countries, sovereign splendours are at a discount. The
East occasionally produces something fine, because there they still
have harems and slaves; but even these ancient institutions are losing
their stability and in the interest of humanity, if not in that of
needlework, we may soon hope there will be neither the one nor the
other. We must allow, however, that the purple and gold embroideries
now being executed for the King of Bavaria in his school at Munich
are royally splendid, and, by their execution, worthy of past days.</p>

The utter dispersal of accumulated family and household
treasures has had a sad illustration in the loads of Turkish and Slav
embroideries which have flooded the markets of Europe since the Russo-Turkish
war. Work, treasured for generations, sold for a piece of bread,
robbed from the deserted home or the bazaar, stolen from the dying or the
dead. These are so suggestive of the horrors of war, and touch us so nearly
in connection with the rights and wrongs of the Eastern question, that
they cause us more pain than pleasure when we study these beautiful
specimens of well-blended colours and designs, that show their Aryan
(Persian or Indian) origin. Lady Layard&rsquo;s residence in Constantinople
was, perhaps, the &ldquo;happy accident&rdquo; which will have preserved the secrets
and practice of this work for future generations, by her active and
generous institution of a working organization for the poor exiled and
starving women, and for the sale of their work in England.</p>

<p>The last chapter on <a href="#Page_260">hangings</a>, their history and uses, and
the preceding account of <a href="#Page_235">tapestries</a>, naturally lead to the
consideration of the furniture which may accompany
them.</p>

<p>Homer&rsquo;s description of Penelope&rsquo;s bridal couch is very
curious. The central idea is the bedpost, fashioned out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
of the stem of an olive-tree growing in the court, and
inlaid by Ulysses himself with gold, silver, and ivory, and
bands of dyed purple ox-hide. The stone walls and roof
were built over to cover it in, as it stood yet rooted in
the ground.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>The illustration is a very quaint delineation of a Chaldean
four-roomed house, where the rooted tree with its stem
and branches is suggestive of the state of the domestic
art of the architect and the upholsterer in those Archaic
days.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>Furniture has been the excuse and the vehicle for
embroideries, from the footstool and the cushion to the
window curtain and the bed-hangings.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>Such curtains are the most permanently important
features in the economy, or rather the luxury of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
house. Let us begin with the decorations of the state
bedroom.</p>

<p>Now the shape of the bed must regulate the design.
If there is only a canopy&mdash;like that over a throne&mdash;one
may have fine work for the head of the bed
inside the canopy, and a rich border round its valance;
this should contrast with the walls; and the curtains
should marry the two together, by the embroidered
borders belonging to the fashion of the bed, and
accompanying the window curtains; while the plain
surface should match with the wall hangings. Another
method is to have the bed and curtains hung with plain
materials, to contrast with embroidered or tapestried
hangings on the walls.</p>

<p>This style of bed canopy absolutely belongs to the
decoration of the wall to which it is attached. But when
we have to deal with a large four-post bed&mdash;&ldquo;a room
within a room,&rdquo; as poor Prince Lee Boo said&mdash;the bed
may, in its own decoration, be totally independent of the
wall hangings; and care must be taken that we do not
injure the effect of both by too much contrast or too much
similarity. Every room has its own individuality, and the
first beginning of its decoration must be the key-note
to guide the rest of the furnishing and adornment. I
am anxious to point out that the bed and its belongings
are a most important element in the beauty and
dignity of style of the room and the house that contains it.
It is a splendid opportunity for displaying the embroideries
of the women of the family, and for exercising their
taste. &ldquo;The chamber of Dais,&rdquo; as it was called in old
times, was always carefully adorned for the welcome of
the honoured guest. The bed-hangings, and even the
linen, were embroidered,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> and the greatest care and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
most artistic work were lavished on the coverlet in
firm stitches and twisted threads, while on the curtains
the frailest materials and most delicate stitches were
freely bestowed, as they were safe from friction. We
may employ floss-silk and satin-stitch for such works
with safety.</p>

<p>As a rule we should avoid too great a variety of design
in the decoration of a bedroom, and at the same time
beware of its becoming monotonous.</p>

<p>I should say that a change in the design, though not
in the style, of the different parts of the bed is admissible,
and gives opportunities for rich and graceful work. For
instance, a parsem&eacute; pattern may be varied judiciously on
the curtains, the valance, and the heading; provided
there is a connecting link (say a cypher) found throughout.
If the back of the Baldachino is embroidered, it
admits of totally different treatment, and the valance
must include a border according to its outline.</p>

<p>The ingenuity and magnificence of the Elizabethan
bedroom furnishings are proved by the inventories to
be found in old houses. Those describing the property
of the Earl of Leicester, in the Library at Longleat,
are so characteristic of a time when each room contained
artistic furniture, that I cannot help making here some
extracts, and pointing out that embroidery was usually
employed to individualize each decoration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Killingworth (Kenilworth) Lord Leicester&rsquo;s Bedsteads.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A fayre, rich, standing Square Bedstead of
carved walnut-tree wood: painted with silver hearts,
ragged staves and roses. The furniture and teste
crimson velvet embroidered with silver roses, and lined
throughout with Buckram.&rdquo; There was apparently a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
second set of curtains inside of striped white satin,
trimmed and fringed with silver, and the velvet curtains
were also fringed with silver with long &ldquo;buttons and
loops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another bedstead is described, with the pillars painted
red, and varnished. The teste and curtains of red silk
edged with gold and silver bone lace, and embroidered
&ldquo;in a border of hops, roses, and pomegranates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another &ldquo;Bedstead painted red and gold, and
varnished; with crimson velvet, gold and silver in
breadths, embroidered over with red, gold, and silver,&mdash;lined
with Milion (Milan) fustian,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c. The
catalogue of the tapestries and embroidered hangings
include fifteen suites at Kenilworth only; and three
other houses are equally well provided. The ground of
one of these suites of five pieces of embroidery, of
animals and flowers, is described as being &ldquo;Stannel cloth
lined with cannevois&rdquo; (canvas). Each room has chairs,
cushions, carpets (which appear to have covered the
floor and the tables), and &ldquo;Cabinutts&rdquo; (cabinets)
covered with embroideries.</p>

<p>In a Florentine Palace (the Alessandri), there is a
state apartment,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> where the bed, the walls, the curtains,
and the furniture are entirely decorated with the same
splendid materials, i.e. gold brocaded with crimson
velvet. The eye longs for some repose amidst the
gorgeous reiterated forms and colours. If the bed and
curtains had been either plain crimson velvet or embroidery,
it would have been much more beautiful. This
sort of example is a lesson and a warning, which is
valuable even under less splendid conditions.</p>

<p>Amongst our fine Indian embroideries, those of Lucknow,
Gulbargah, Aurungabad, and Hyderabad are well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
fitted for beds and furniture. These we can study in the
Indian Museum, and it seems a pity not to profit by, and
encourage the resources of our own Empire.</p>

<p>Carpets and rugs were sometimes embroidered as well
as woven in patterns. They were anciently spread on
thrones, couches and sofas, at entertainments;<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> and used
for covering the catafalques at funeral ceremonies, or
for laying over tombs, as is still the custom in the East.
We who restrict their use to domestic purposes, are
beginning to understand that these decorations look best
when the patterns are geometrical, and that natural
objects, such as rabbits and roses, even when conventionalized,
are unpleasant to tread upon.</p>

<p>The sofa and chairs are so often the vehicles for
embroidery that we must give them a separate share of
our attention. The square shapes of the chair-backs repeated
several times give us an opportunity for balancing
colours and introducing forms of decoration which may
be made to contrast with everything else in the room, and
so enhance the general effect. Say that the carpet is red,
and the furniture and hangings are of tender broken tints,
it will be a pleasure to the eye if the cushions on the sofa
and the chairs and seats are panelled with a deeper or
lighter colour than the carpet, but always reposing the
eye by contrasting plain surfaces with richness of design.
Then the footstool or cushion should break away entirely
from the carpet on which it lies, that the poor thing may
be spared the kick it invariably receives, when the master
of the house has tripped over its invisible presence.</p>

<p>For furniture, the cushion stitches, i.e. canvas and cross
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
stitches, are certainly the best. They are the most
enduring, as they bear friction without fraying; and are
therefore, in this case, preferable to satin stitches, which
are liable to be spoilt by contact, and give the lady
of the house, who is probably the artist, a pang each
time an honoured guest occupies the comfortable chair
embroidered in floss silk, unaware that it is an &aelig;sthetic
investment, and that a percentage of its beauty is disappearing
every time it is brought into collision with broadcloth.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
This brings us to the subject of the covers called
&ldquo;housses&rdquo; by French upholsterers, and which may come
under the head of small decorations, or rather, of petty
disfigurements. The things which went by the horrid
name of &ldquo;antimacassars&rdquo; have, however, given way to
&ldquo;chair-backs,&rdquo; and crochet has been displaced by linen
veils worked in crewels. This is a step in the right direction.
No well-regulated eye could do otherwise than
suffer from the glaring white patterns of crochet-work,
mounted aggressively on the back of every chair in the
room, as a buffer between it and the human head and
shoulders. The suggestion was disagreeable, and the
present chair-back still recalls it. To reconcile us to
its use, it must be sparingly used, and artistically disposed.
The &ldquo;antimacassar&rdquo; is a remaining sign of
the overlap of dress and manners. Our great-grandmothers
embroidered the chairs, and valued
them exceedingly, and never would have contemplated
that they should be soiled by a male or female head
lying back upon them. True, they wore powder and
pomatum then&mdash;but they never leant back; such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
solace, and solecism in manners, was reserved for the
privacy of the bedroom and the arm-chair covered with
cotton piqu&eacute; or washing chintz. Under the new manners,
and since the introduction of the graceful lounge, the
antimacassar doubtless has saved many ancestral works,
but nowadays we wear neither powder nor pomatum.
On the contrary, we dye, dry, and frizzle our hair till it
might serve as a brush to remove any dust it encountered,
and it spoils nothing.</p>

<p>The table-cover is a source of endless variety;<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> on the
whole I should recommend here plain surfaces and deep
borders. The articles thrown on the table are best set
off by plain grounds. The colour of the table-cover may
be a test of artistic taste, and may make or mar the
whole effect of the furnishings of the room, especially
if it is newly acquired, in order to enliven the fading
glories of ancestral taste.</p>

<p>The Screen.&mdash;This evidently began its existence as a
curtain hung on a movable frame for the purpose of
dividing large chambers for separate uses.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> The Chinese
seem to have been the first to stretch the curtain tight
over the frame, making it a fixture, and often an actual
partition, painted with pictures by brush or needle.</p>

<p>To our modern home, the screen in a large room,
gives a sense of snugness, and is an actual necessity for
keeping off the draughts drifting in through ill-fitting
window-frames and doors; and at the same time serving
&aelig;sthetically as a background to high chairs and tables
heaped with objects of art, and tall vases of flowers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
The high screen groups and unites the pictures of active
and still life around it; and meanwhile the little fire-screens
are performing the merciful service of saving the
complexions of our daughters from being sacrificed to
Moloch in front of our scorching coal fires. I need not
recommend these as fit surfaces for embroidery&mdash;they
offer themselves to it; and the School of Art Needlework
is a living witness to how much they are appreciated
and how largely employed. On the screen, decorative
ambition is permitted to rise to pictorial art. Nothing in
furniture is prettier than the screen covered with refined
needle painting, either arabesqued or naturalistic. You
may vary the designs to any extent, either as large pictures
covering many folds, or in small pictures repeated or
varied on each. Here design to individualize the living-room
comes into play, and is most conspicuous for good
or for evil effect.</p>

<p>Amongst the occasional furnishings of the home, we
would instance embroidered curtains to veil pictures,
which are perhaps too sacred to expose to the general eye.
We know how often in churches and sacristies on the
Continent, one, or even two veils have to be withdrawn
before the holy and precious picture is displayed. We
have seen these little curtains beautifully worked so as
to form by their design a picture in the space they cover.
Crimson silk is perhaps worked in gold and colours for a
gilt frame, and white and silver within ebony or walnut
settings. I would recommend this style of work to the
consideration of our decorators. It is interesting to find
in an old catalogue at Hampton Court, how pictures of
sacred subjects were thus decently veiled, in the profaner
moments of court gaieties.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
Embroidered book coverings were often very beautiful,
either as simply clothing the boards, or when finished
with metal-work corners, backs, and clasps.</p>

<p>I quote the following lines, said to have been written
by Tasso on a case for a book, embroidered for him by
Leonora d&rsquo;Este:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Questo prezioso dono,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ch&rsquo; ornar coll&rsquo; ago ad Eleanora piacque,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo vidde Aracne, e tacque.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or se la mano, che la piaga f&egrave; al core,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si bello f&egrave; d&rsquo; amore il dolce laberinto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come uscirne potro, se non estinto?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the catalogue of Charles V.&rsquo;s library, the materials
used for bindings are thus named: Soie veluyau, satin
damas, taffetas, camelot, cendal, and drap d&rsquo;or; and many
were embroidered.</p>

<p>Tact, discretion, and knowledge are required when we
undertake to adorn the home to be lived in; and while
employing the art of embroidery to embellish it, we must
never forget that harmony, and the absence of anything
startling, tends to the grandiose as well as the comfortable.
Bright bits of colouring should be reserved for pictorial art,
or for small objects, such as cushions and stools. If for
the general tint blue be chosen, let it be either pure pale
colour, like the &aelig;ther, or a soft one, pale or dark, such as
indigo; but the startling aniline blues should be avoided
as being offensive to the nerves of the eye. If red be the
foundation colour, let it be Venetian red, part scarlet, part
crimson; or pure crimson (Tyrian purple), or pure scarlet
(cochineal). Never employ scarlet with a yellow tinge; it
may not affect yourself, but it is blinding to many eyes.
Avoid brickdust, which is simply a dirty mixture of earthy
colours. Of green there are few shades that are not beautiful,
soothing, and more or less fitted for a background to
needlework. Olive-green, sea-green, pea-green, emerald-green,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
and sage-green,&mdash;Nature teaches us how these
harmonize together and with all other colours. Only
arsenical green is impracticable and repulsive. Yellow,
pale as a primrose, glowing as gold, or tender as butter,
is always beautiful; but one tint we would exclude
from our list, called &ldquo;buff,&rdquo; which never can assimilate
with any other colour, and is often the refuge of the weak-minded
man that cannot face the responsibility of choosing
an atmosphere in which he will have to spend many hours
of his existence, when the walls, the ceiling, and the
hangings will inevitably obtain a subtle, but real influence
on his nerves; which, in the case of buff, will be that of
a yellow fog, while pale primrose will have the effect of
early sunrise, and pure gold that of sunset.</p>

<p>A rule to be respected is that decoration should be
reposing instead of exciting. The unexpected, which is
an element in the enjoyment of what is new, should be
such as to become the more agreeable the longer we are
accustomed to it. Mr. Morris&rsquo;s golden rule is this:
&ldquo;Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to
be useful or believe to be beautiful.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> In decorative art,
and therefore in embroidery, the first object to consider
is beauty&mdash;beauty in conception, proportion, drawing, and
colour. I would not have it thought that I am placing
our secondary art too high, and giving it too much importance,
when I apply to it the first essential rules of art;
but one of these furnishes my excuse. It is that &ldquo;the
simplest and smallest creation should be as faultless as
the greatest and grandest.&rdquo; Now beauty cannot be
obtained, even in little works, without proportion in
size, harmony and balance in colour, and correctness
in form, and these require the careful study of first
principles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
Proportion in size is most important, both as regards
ourselves and our surroundings&mdash;objectively and subjectively.
When our masters, the Greeks, wished to
express force and majesty, they sculptured their gods of
unearthly size, larger than their heroes, who yet exceeded
in stature their human models. The statue of the god
placed in the temple was the largest object seen, and
the delicacy and refinement of the details in dress, throne,
and base only enhanced the effect of majestic proportion.</p>

<p>In the temple men were to be reminded of their own
nothingness. In the gymnasium, and on the racecourse,
and at the public games, the surrounding pictures and
statues were all intended to excite ambition by showing
men the heroic size to be attained by the awards of fame.
But at home, in the house, man is already supreme, and
needs no incentive to assert himself, and no tall standard
by which he may be measured. The Lares and Penates
themselves were very small objects to look at, whatever
may have been the thoughts they suggested. Nothing
is so alarming or unpleasant as gigantic figures worked
in tapestry or embroidery.</p>

<p>And if even the guardian gods of the house were kept
in due subjection as to size, why not all decorations, and
especially those representing the flowers of the field?
Certainly in worked decorations flowers should be no
larger than in nature&mdash;perhaps on the whole they are
best rather smaller. Botanical monstrosities on the wall
dwarf the flowers in a bow-pot near them, and
nature has her own lovely proportions, which should
be studied and respected. These remarks, of course,
apply exclusively to domestic decoration, which is the
special object of our art, and for the guidance of
which the suggestions contained in this chapter are
intended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
I would strongly advocate the return to the old system
for the production of large embroideries. If ladies
would design, or have designed for them, curtains or
tapestries, and let the work-frame be the permanent
occupier of the morning sitting-room, they might at least
commence works that members of the family or friends
might continue and complete at their leisure; and should
they at any time hang fire, a needlewoman or clever professional
worker might be called in to help to finish it.
Thus ladies might assist the art of needlework by their
own original ideas, and give individual beauty to their
homes, and an impetus to the occupation which helps to
support so many of our struggling sisters. The frame or
m&eacute;tier is always a pretty object in the drawing-room or
boudoir. The French understand this well; and make it
one of their most useful &ldquo;properties&rdquo; in their scenic
representations of refined home life.</p>

<p>I will conclude this chapter with two quotations. The
first is part of Sir Digby Wyatt&rsquo;s advice in a Cambridge
Lecture. &ldquo;You can never hope (he says) to have
the means of supplying yourself with what is beautiful
unless you take pains to add to the production of that
beauty. The colour which the decorative painter&rdquo; (and
the embroiderer also) &ldquo;may cast around you is neither
more nor less than an atmosphere in which your eye will
be either strengthened or debilitated. If you accustom
your eye only or mainly to contemplate what is satisfactory
in colour and form to the highest tastes, it will
gradually become allured to such delicacy of organization
as to reject unintentionally all that is repugnant to perfect
taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Morris, in a lecture to the &ldquo;Birmingham Society
of Arts and School of Design,&rdquo; says of ugly furnishings:
&ldquo;Herein the rich people have defrauded themselves as
well as the poor. You will see a refined and highly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
educated man nowadays, who has been to Italy and Egypt
and where not, who can talk learnedly enough (and fantastically
enough sometimes) about art and literature of past
days, sitting down without signs of discomfort in a house
that, with all its surroundings, is just brutally vulgar and
hideous. All his education has done for him no more
than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot civilize man unless you give him a share
in art.&rdquo; But the man must be civilized by education to
accept that share of art that his life offers to him. It must
be admitted that though a man may be educated enough to
enable him to theorize, he may yet be too poor to furnish
with taste. If he is able to act up to his theories, and to
surround himself with what is refined, and fail to do so,
and is contented not to stir in this matter, he is not truly
educated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that which breeds art is art. Any piece of
work that is well done is so much help to the cause.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The cause is the Democracy of Art, the ennobling of
daily and common work.&rdquo;</p>

A bed may be absolutely without any hangings or tester, and yet
carry embroidery, as in the curious funeral couch of a sepulchral
monument in painted terra-cotta in the Campana Museum of the
Louvre. Here the mattress is worked to resemble ticking, striped,
and the cushions have embroidered ends; and are made in the form
of bolsters. There is a similar sepulchral monument in the British
Museum. Both of them were found at Cervetri, and are quaint
examples of early Etruscan art. See Dennis&rsquo; &ldquo;Etruria,&rdquo; 2nd ed., p. 227.</p>

<h3>DRESS.</h3>

<p>Having glanced at the decoration of the house, I must
now proceed to say a few words on Dress. Semper,
Labarte, and Sir Digby Wyatt all take it for granted that
the Art of Dress preceded all other arts.</p>

<p>Every ancient record shows how early decoration of
dress by needlework began, and how far it had gone;
and when we read of festal hospitalities and marriage
gifts, embroidered garments are invariably named. Solomon
in all his glory, though he praised the lily, yet shone
in splendid apparel. The Greeks refined the gold, and
painted the lily.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Italian Knight dressed for conquest, by Gentile da Fabriano.
Academia at Florence.</p>

<p>As soon as dress became an art, and not merely an
acknowledged necessity for warmth and decency, I see
no reason to deny that the same decorative genius that
embroidered the garment might at the same time have
imagined the carving of the chair and the inlaying of the
sword and bow; but as regards the precedence of the
arts, we can only guess at what is probable. Beauty in
dress is certainly a universal instinctive passion. Perhaps
the birds (which Mr. Darwin and others credit with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
preening their plumage, conscious that their spots are
the brightest, and their feathers the glossiest, and that
they are therefore adored by the hens, and the envy of
the shabbier cocks) suggested to men the same method
for securing the preference of the other sex, who in return
willingly helped to adorn the idols of their hearts and
homes. (Plate <a href="#pl50">50</a>.) This natural state of things still
prevails in Central Africa, where Schweinf&uuml;rth describes
a king dancing before his 100 wives costumed in the tails
of lions and peacocks, and crowned with the proboscis
of an elephant. It appears, however, that, unlike Cleopatra,
&ldquo;custom had staled his infinite variety,&rdquo; and the
100 ladies looked on the splendid display with blank
indifference.</p>

<p>This is only a barbarous illustration of the fact that in
the earliest civilizations magnificent garments were worn
by men to dazzle and awe the beholders by the splendour
which represented wealth and conquest. How glorious a
man could appear apparelled to represent majesty and
dominion, may be learned by studying Canon Rock&rsquo;s
book on the coronation dresses of the Emperors of Germany&mdash;a
book great in every sense of the word. The
portrait of Charles V. robed and crowned is a dazzling
example of the arts of dress, embroidery, and jeweller&rsquo;s
work. These garments have for ages been treasured at
Vienna, Aix-la-Chapelle, and in the Vatican at Rome.</p>

<p>The coronation garments of the Emperors of Russia
are said to be gorgeously beautiful.</p>

<p>It seems hardly necessary to assert that embroidery
has always been especially applicable to dress. Each
garment, being individualized by the design depicted on
it, was fitted for individual uses and occasions. The
conqueror&rsquo;s palmated mantle, the coronation robe, the
bridal garment, the costume of the peasant for festival
days, and the officiating vestments of the priests for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
special services of prayer and praise&mdash;these were loyally
or piously worked; they descended from generation to
generation as family treasures or as historical memorials,
and sometimes as holy relics,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> till they and the call for
them, were swept away at once by social changes; yet
some still remain and hold their place. Priestly garments,
together with Church decorations, never laid aside in the
Roman and Greek Churches, are being partially revived
in our own; and for secular adornment the embroiderer
is often called upon to work a garland, to enwreathe the
form of a pretty woman, to lie on her shoulders and
encircle her waist.</p>

<p>The greatest loss to the art is that men as a rule have
ceased to individualize themselves, or their position or
office by dress,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> and have left entirely to the women the
pleasure and duty of making themselves as lovely and
conspicuous as their circumstances will permit. The
same linen and broadcloth are cut in the same shapes, of
which the only merit is that they are said to be comfortable,
and whose highest aim is to be spotless and unwrinkled;
these show the altered conditions of the highly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
civilized man, and woman too, for he has long left behind
him the idea of dazzling the female eye or heart by the
attraction of colour. This applies only to European
costume at home or in the colonies. The East still
retains its pleasure in gorgeous combinations, in which
man enfolds his person, and shows how beautiful he can
make himself when thus clothed, in accordance with
the classical axioms, as to how much of the human form
should be revealed, and how much concealed.</p>

<p>The principle on which the ancients embroidered their
garments was like that of the Indians, the large surfaces
plain, or covered with quiet diapers or spots, the rich
ornaments being reserved for the borders, the girdles and
the scarves. Their garments hung loose from the
shoulders or girdle; whether long or short they clung to
the figure or fluttered in the wind. The long flowing
robes to the feet veiled the form completely, and were
only thrown off for the battle or the chase, or in the
struggles for victory in the races and games. Dress,
in the supreme reign of beauty, was intended to flow
around, or to conceal, but never to <em>disguise</em>, the human
frame it enclosed.</p>

<p>Homer thus describes Juno&rsquo;s toilet before calling on
Jupiter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Around her next a heavenly mantle flow&rsquo;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rich with Pallas&rsquo; labour&rsquo;d colours glow&rsquo;d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Large clasps of gold the foldings gather&rsquo;d round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A golden zone her swelling bosom bound.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="poet">Iliad, xiv. v. 207.</p>
</div>


<p>The Greeks certainly wore delicate and tasteful embroidery
on their garments, frequently finished with
splendid borders, while the large space between was
dotted with stars or some simple pattern. We learn
this from the paintings on Greek fictile vases. In the
British Museum there is a little bronze statuette of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
Minerva (with twinkling diamond eyes). She has a
broad band of embroidered silver foliage from her throat
to her feet.</p>

<p>As the beauty of Greek forms acted and reacted on
the beauty of their &ldquo;Art of Dress,&rdquo; so we may be certain
that all deformity of dress has been produced by deformity
of race in mind or body, and that climate is an important
factor in both. The cold of the farthest north has produced
people short, fat, and hairy; which natural gifts have been
supplemented by their warm clothes or coverings, in
the same way that a &ldquo;cosy&rdquo; covers a teapot. Flowing
garments there would be utterly out of place, petticoats
are unknown, and the Lapp hangs out nothing that can
be the vehicle for carrying an icicle. Their dresses, or
cases, are planned to keep out the cold, and to place
another atmosphere between the heart of the breathing
mass, and the cruel, cutting, outer wind. Hence, the
materials used are not only woven hair, but the furry skins
themselves. In the south, under the sunshine, dress is
for the greater part of the year only needed for decency
and beauty. The flowing and delicate cottons and silks
and fine woollens, are shaped to cover and adorn the
beautiful forms, which for entire isolation take refuge in
the never-failing mantle. The mantle was the great
opportunity for the embroiderer&rsquo;s craft. Alkisthenes,
the Sybarite, had a garment of such magnificence that
when it was exhibited in the Temple of Juno at Lacinium,
where all Italy was congregated, it attracted such
universal admiration that it was sold to the Carthaginians
by Dionysius the Elder for 120 talents. The ground
was purple, wrought all over with animals, except the
centre, where were seen Jupiter, Juno, Apollo, Minerva,
Venus, and Themis. On one border was the figure of
Alkisthenes himself, on the other was depicted the emblematic
figure of his native city, Sybaris. The size of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
the garment was Homeric&mdash;it was fifteen cubits, or
twenty-two feet in breadth.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>That the ladies of Greece in the fourth century carried
down the historical and Homeric traditions of the
embroidery frame, and made it part of their daily lives,
while the Persian women of rank left such work to
their slaves, is evident from the pretty legend told of
Alexander the Great, who desiring to beguile the weariness
of his prisoners, the wife and family of Darius, sent them
some of his garments to embroider. When it was
reported to him that these princesses were much mortified,
believing it was a suggestion of their fallen fortunes,
Alexander hastened to reassure them&mdash;saying that his
own mother and sisters occupied themselves in embroidering
dresses.</p>

<p>The Persians and Babylonians seem to have preferred
subjects for their embroidered dresses somewhat in the
style of the mantle of Alkisthenes, which was probably
Oriental, and suggests the Babylonian mantle in Jericho,
&ldquo;which tempted Achan to sin.&rdquo; The Egyptian frescoes
on the other hand, sometimes give us women and goddesses
dressed in small flowery patterns that remind
one of Indian chintzes. These were probably woven,
painted, and embroidered, and filled in with threads
of gold. The Romans varied their fashions, but
they preferred for a time striped borders on their garments,<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
and called them &ldquo;molores,&rdquo; &ldquo;dilores,&rdquo; &ldquo;trilores,&rdquo;
up to seven. The Greeks but seldom departed from
the rule of plain or quietly patterned surfaces with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
rich borders in their delineations of dress, though there
are examples of large designs covering the whole garment.</p>

<p>The embroidered dresses of early Christian times are
to be judged of by mosaics and frescoes&mdash;mostly Italian.
Those of the dark ages were till lately only names and
guesses. But a hiatus in our knowledge has been filled up
lately by the store of entombed textiles discovered in
the Fayoum in Egypt, and now at Vienna, in Herr
Graf&rsquo;schen&rsquo;s Collection. Here we have a variety of
shapes, designs, and stitches, and every kind of subject,
sacred and profane, Christian and Pagan, and the missing
links between Indian and Byzantine fabrics are revealed.
They cover nearly 400 years, from the third to the seventh
century, and many of them may be looked upon as apart
from any ecclesiastical or even Christian suggestions.
I have spoken of them in the chapter on <a href="#Page_125">Woollen Materials</a>.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>After the seventh century, we again come into the
dawning light of history&mdash;and find here and there an
illustrative fragment, nearly always ecclesiastical, taken
from the graves of priests and monarchs. Charlemagne&rsquo;s
mantle and robe embroidered with elephants
and with bees, preserved at Aix-la-Chapelle&mdash;his
dalmatic in the Vatican&mdash;the Durham embroideries, are
rare and precious examples of that early period.</p>

<p>Semper describes the difference between &ldquo;the
covering&rdquo; and the &ldquo;binding.&rdquo; This seems to be little
considered in modern costume, but it is so essential that
I would impress it on my readers. He says that
&ldquo;the covering seeks to isolate, to enclose, to shelter, to
spread around, over a certain space, and is a collective
unit,&rdquo; whereas binding implies ligature, and represents a
&ldquo;united plurality,&rdquo;&mdash;for example, a bundle of sticks, the
<i>fasces</i> of the lictors, &amp;c. &ldquo;Binding is linear, in dress it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
is either horizontal or spiral.&rdquo; What can the united
plurality be that justifies the binding often bestowed on
the figure in fashionable costumes? more fitted for
binding together the bones of the dead, than for
permitting the agility of the muscles of the living.
Semper continues,&mdash;&ldquo;Anything that goes against this
important axiom is wrong.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>I think we must all agree that the objects of dress are
decency, isolation, warmth, grace, and beauty. As long
as fashion takes the place of taste, and extravagant <i>chic</i>
supersedes grace and beauty, we must not hope that fine
designs to individualize dress will be called for. The
French machine-made embroideries are so beautiful, and
comparatively cheap, that we cannot compete with them.
The best artists design them, and the only fault to be
found is this, that as they are made by thousands of
yards, and can only be varied by interchange of colours,
they become common the day they are produced. It has
been said that &ldquo;fashion is made for a class, but taste
for mankind.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Fashion is the enemy of taste, though
she makes use of her services. The gown, of which the
fashion is in every sense imported from France, will
probably never again be the vehicle for home embroideries.
But there are other articles of personal adornment which
will always be available for the fancies of decorative taste&mdash;the
fan, the purse or satchel, the apron, the fichu, the
point of the shoe, and the muff&mdash;all these are objects on
which thought and ingenuity may well be expended, and
which will remain as records of personal feeling when the
workers and givers of such graceful mementoes are far
away. Carriage-rugs and foot-muffs, and embroidered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
letter-cases, and book-covers, must be placed somewhere
between furniture and personal ornament. In all these
the &ldquo;<i>impr&eacute;vu</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;unexpected,&rdquo; is what is valuable,
including all that is original and quaint.</p>

<p>Embroidery will, however, probably continue occasionally
to be employed in the adornment of dress&mdash;and
will leave of each phase and period of art some fine
examples on which the arch&aelig;ologist of the future may
pause and reason.</p>

<p>There are in most old houses some specimens of old
secular work&mdash;few earlier than the date of Henry VIII.
Gothic dress is very rare, except the ecclesiastical. But
from the fifteenth century till now, there remains enough
to exercise our curiosity, our artistic tastes, and our power
of selection and comparison; and hints for beauty and
grace may often be found and adapted to the style of
our own day.</p>

<p>Planch&eacute;&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dictionary of Dress,&rdquo; and Ferrario&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Costumi antichi e moderni di tutti i Popoli,&rdquo; are great
works on dress and costume, and both are splendidly
illustrated and worthy of study.</p>

Elsewhere I have spoken of dress being continually offered to the
images of the pagan gods in the temples. Herodotus (ii. p. 159) tells
us that Pharaoh Necho offered to the Apollo of Branchid&aelig; the
dress he happened to have worn at both his great successes (the victory
of Magdalus and the taking of Cadytis). In the procession of Ptolemy
Philadelphus the colossal statue of Bacchus and his nurse Nysa were
draped, the former in a shawl, the latter in a tunic variegated with
gold. See Yates, &ldquo;Textrinum Antiquorum,&rdquo; p. 369. Old clothes were
sent as votive offerings to temples, and inscriptions recording lists
of such decorations are still extant. See <a href="#appendix_i">Appendix 1</a>. The Greeks
honoured the menders and darners, and called them &ldquo;healers of clothes.&rdquo;

Men in former days preferred to show by their dress their station
and the company they belonged to. Guilds had their ceremonial dresses,
and their &ldquo;liveries,&rdquo; and their cognizances, and considered it an honour
to wear them. See Rock, &ldquo;Church of our Fathers,&rdquo; ii. p. 115.</p>

hangings and dress embroidered with lions, panthers, huntsmen,

a small class, and mankind follows it, whether good or bad, if it only
be the fashion.</p>

</div>


<p>If the Bride is the type of the Church, how truly has
she been, for eighteen centuries, throughout Christendom,
adorned with gold, and arrayed in raiment of needlework.</p>

<p>By ecclesiastical embroideries, we mean, of course,
Christian work for Christian churches. The first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
pictured decorations of our era, in early frescoes, mosaics,
and illuminated MSS., and the first specimens that
have come down to us of needlework and textiles, testify
by their <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> to their date.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p>The prosperity of the Church&rsquo;s hierarchy was founded
on the ruins of the Empire, over which Attila had boasted
that where his horse trod no grass grew; and truly the
cultivated art of those splendid days had lapsed at once
to a poverty of design and barrenness of ideas which
would soon have dwindled into mere primitive forms, had
not a fresh Oriental impulse arrived from Syria, Egypt,
and Byzantium,&mdash;and then the arts were born anew.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
The continuity was broken; yet, being devoted to the
service of the Church, the new arts were by it moulded
and fostered. Little lamps twinkled here and there in
monastic houses. Hangings for the churches, coverings
for the altars, robes for the priests, occupied the artist
and the embroiderer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
The forms, the colours, the uses, were adapting themselves
to become the symbols of orthodoxies and heresies,
and thus became a part of the history of the Church.
The links are many between them and the history of the
State; and here ecclesiastical embroideries come in as
landmarks.</p>

<p>Royal and princely garments, which had served for
state occasions, were constantly dedicated as votive
offerings, and converted into vestments for the officiating
priest, and so were recorded and preserved.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>Royal and noble ladies employed their leisure hours in
work for the adornment of the Minster or the home
church or chapel. Gifts of the best were exchanged
between convents, or forwarded to the holy father at
Rome, and were often enriched with jewels. The images
of the Virgin and saints received from wealthy penitents
many costly garments,<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> besides money and lands.</p>

<p>This dedicatory needlework has preserved to us the
records of classical, Byzantine, and Arab-Gothic design,
which otherwise must have been lost.</p>

<p>The Church records and illuminated MSS. give us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
most trustworthy information of the way in which the
altars, the priests, and even the kings were arrayed; and
the catalogues of royal wardrobes are also very instructive,
as we find how often princely gauds became, as gifts to
the Church, commemorative of historical events, such as
a victory or an accession, a marriage or a coronation.</p>

<p>Woltmann and Woermann say that the efforts of the
Christians in the time of Constantine tended to delay the
extinction of classical design in Rome. Of the fourth
century they give as examples the mosaics of &ldquo;S<sup>ta.</sup> Pudenziana,&rdquo;
where we can still find antique beauty of design.
We may also mention the church of &ldquo;St. Agnese fuori
le mura,&rdquo; which once contained the sarcophagi of
Constantine and his mother Helena, and of which the
decorations in the ceilings are entirely classical, though
the motives had been transferred to Christian
symbolism.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>The total disappearance of Greek art did not occur
till the eighth century, when the new blood infused from
foreign sources began to assert itself.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>Rome had succeeded to Greece as being the centre of
Christian art, which assumed the phase commonly
called the Romanesque. This was a conglomerate of
Oriental, Byzantine, and Gr&aelig;co-Roman, varied in
different countries. Then there were the Scandinavian,
and Runic, and Celtic styles drifting from the North;
the Lombardic, of Central Italy; the Ostro-Gothic, of
Ravenna; the Byzantine, of Venice, all acting and reacting
upon each other.</p>

<p>All these rough and inchoate attempts at the beautiful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
prepared the world for the acceptance of the Arabic
influence, which is said to have been imported at the end
of the eleventh century by the Crusaders, to whose
pious enterprise some attribute the whole of the splendid
Gothic art of the three succeeding centuries. But the
marking characteristic of the Arabic arch is wanting;
the ogee shape is seldom to be found in Christian architecture;<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
and the pointed arch so naturally results from
the intersection of the round arches, that we cannot but
look upon these causes as co-incident.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere remarked how often in art different
causes co-operate to form a style. The father and
mother are of different nationalities, and the result shows
the characteristics of its double parentage. The learned
antiquaries, who draw their arguments mainly from the
form of the arch, must settle whence and how Gothic art
in stone came into Europe. It was doubtless the effect
or result of more than one cause.</p>

<p>But in as far as it influenced textile art, we have come
to the period when it must be studied in Sicily, the half-way
house and resting-place of the Crusaders on their
highroad to the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Sicily, which had succeeded to Constantinople as being
the great manufacturing mart during the Middle Ages,
was, in the hands of the Moors, the origin and source
of all European Gothic textile art. Yet even at Palermo
and Messina they were controlled by the traditions of
the schools of Greece, ancient and modern, and by
Babylonian, Indian, and African forms and symbolisms.</p>

<p>Byzantium furnished many of their designs, which were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
sometimes of very remote date, though pressed into the
service of the new style and the Church.</p>

<p>These and all the streams of ecclesiastical decoration
throughout Europe flowed towards Rome, and were
re-issued with the fiat and seal of the Central Church,
which also afterwards presided over the art of the
Renaissance.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>By studying what remains to us of fragments and
records we know all the materials which clothed the
primitive and medi&aelig;val Church, and we find that there
was but little originality in textile decoration or in the
forms of dress, which either resembled those of the priests
in the Jewish synagogue or those of the heathen temples;
and were adapted from traditional patterns.</p>

<p>The constant repetition of the cross and the signs of
the Passion, with the emblems of saints and martyrs,
were interwoven with the ancient classical forms, mixed
up with the old symbolisms partially altered to suit their
new service of Christian art. Of course such changes
were inevitable, while the old motives were being translated
to the new uses.</p>

<p>The corselet of Amasis (the Egyptian corselet, p. 20,
<i>ante</i>) closely resembles the Jewish ephod, which probably
was borrowed from Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>In Rock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Church of Our Fathers,&rdquo; vol. i. p. 409, we
find mention of the consular trabea, profusely worked in
gold, as being the origin of the cope.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">St. Mark. Anglo-Saxon Book of the Four Gospels in the Cathedral Library at York.</p>

<p>It has been suggested and disputed that the stole was
an adaptation of the latus clavus; indeed, if we compare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>309]</a></span>
the examples given by Bock<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> we can hardly doubt that
the consular trabea and the latus clavus either served as
the models for the Christian Bishop&rsquo;s dress, or were
derived from the same traditional sources. Such is the
intimate chain of design from century to century, from age
to age; from Egypt to the Holy Land, and thence to Rome.</p>

<p>Bock gives his authorities for saying that the clavus
was sometimes an applied border, sometimes a loose
stripe hanging down in front, as may be seen in two
consular diptychs given in plate <a href="#pl70">70</a>. Much has been
written on this latus clavus, its origin and meaning, and
I shall return to it in reference to the chrysoclavus
pattern, p. 337, <i>post</i>, and I refer the reader, who may
wish to enter more fully into the questions raised by conflicting
opinions regarding the clavus, to Marquardt&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Handbuch R&ouml;m. Alterth&uuml;mer,&rdquo; vii. p. 2, pp. 528-533,
where great learning and ingenuity have been expended,
without arriving at any satisfactory conclusions.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>This keeping to the old lines and outward appearance
as much as possible was mainly due to a regard for
safety during the persecutions, and also to the Christian
spirit of adoption and conversion, rather than that of antagonism,
which influenced all their early manifestations.</p>

<p>This unchanging character of art was also partly
owing to the absolute sterility of the ashes of Roman
Imperialism.</p>

<p>It is true that through the Dark Ages individual genius
occasionally flashed and left a mark here and there;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
but such phenomena are so rare, that when they occur
we hesitate before we assign them to that age.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon art of illumination shows these inspired
moments; I would point to their drawings in the
books in the Bodleian at Oxford, and the &ldquo;Book of the
Four Gospels&rdquo; (of the tenth century) in the Minster
Library at York, which are original and graceful, and have
a reflection from the classical traditions. To an artistic
eye they are beautiful. (Plate <a href="#pl51">51</a>.)</p>

<p>The conscientious colouring of the Anglo-Saxon
MSS. is liturgical. Mr. Clapton Rolfe<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> says that the
Levitical traditions in the earlier system of decoration in
the Christian Church had a far stronger hold on the
popular mind than we are willing now to admit; and that
the five Levitical colours, gold, blue, purple, red, and white,
were retained in the Christian ritual. Whenever we come
across figures of Anglo-Saxon bishops, the liturgical vesture
entirely agrees with the Biblical description.</p>

<p>Embroideries before the twelfth century generally
preserve a semi-Roman, semi-Oriental character, which
is nearly related to the art which is called Lombardic.
This differs from what we know of Scandinavian and
Celtic design through illuminated books,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> carving on stone
crosses throughout the north of Europe, Great Britain,
and Ireland, and the remains we possess of their metal
work. I am not aware of any ecclesiastical embroideries
which show a Celtic origin,<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> unless the intertwined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
patterns on Italian dresses in paintings of the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries may be supposed to be derived
from that source. (See p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>, <i>ante</i>.)</p>

<p>In accounting for the instances of evident Oriental
influence on Christian art, which came through Byzantium,
we must not restrict ourselves to searching out the
Arabian traditions, but we must remember also how much
Babylon and Persia, as well as India, had given to the
Empire of the East, and these influences were in full
force at the time that Christian art was being organized.</p>

<p>We know, for example, that the great veil of the
temple at Jerusalem, given by Herod, was Babylonian.</p>

<p>The materials&mdash;linen, silk, and woollen&mdash;on which
ecclesiastical embroideries were worked at Rome and
Constantinople were accepted all over the Christian
world. The fabrics were plain, striped, and figured;
and came from Persia and India, Greece, Alexandria, and
Egypt. Even Chinese and Thibetian stuffs are often
named. Cloths of gold and silver also came from the
East, as in the days of Attalus. All these furnished the
grounds on which needlework was lavishly spent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
The great veils which divided the pagan and Jewish
temples were at first adopted in the Christian churches,
but they gradually disappeared from common use, in spite
of occasional survivals and revivals during the Dark
Ages.</p>

<p>Records exist of the hangings of the ancient basilica of
St. Peter at Rome, spread between the pillars supporting
the baldachino over the high altar and those of the choir;
and at the Ostro-Gothic imperial court of Ravenna, in the
fifth century, Maximianus ordered a set of similar splendid
curtains (tetravela) to be worked for the altar. Anastasius
Bibliothecarius (ninth century), in his biographies
of the popes, mentions curtains and embroidered altar-pieces
worked in the sixth and seventh centuries.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Sergius (<small>A.D.</small> 687) ordered four white and four scarlet
curtains, and Pope John (701) hung white ones between
the pillars on either side of the altar at St. Paul&rsquo;s.
St. Zacharias<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> gave similar hangings to the churches of
St. Peter and St. Paul. Stephen IV. placed immense
silver curtains at the entrance of the basilica of St.
Peter&rsquo;s, and in 768 gave to it sixty-five curtains of
figured Syrian stuffs.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> The same hangings prevailed at
intervals in England, France, and Germany, till the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when the new Gothic
style of high, pointed arches altered the decorative
customs.</p>

From Anastasius&rsquo;s mode of speaking of ecclesiastical
garments, it appears that they were named in the
treasury catalogues after the animals represented on
them&mdash;&ldquo;the peacock garment,&rdquo; &ldquo;the elephant casula,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the lion cope.&rdquo; Evidently these were Oriental gold
brocades, Indian or Persian, or else reproductions of
their designs, and from Auberville&rsquo;s and Bock&rsquo;s books of
engravings we can judge how they repeated and varied
their motives. One woven subject, which evidently
started its textile career as one of the labours of Hercules,
was gradually transferred to Samson, or to Daniel
in the lions&rsquo; den. (Plate 4, Auberville&rsquo;s &ldquo;L&rsquo;Ornement
des Tissus.&rdquo;) (Plate <a href="#pl52">52</a>.)<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>However, in Russia and throughout the Greek Church
the ancient Byzantine use of hangings still remains in
force.</p>

<p>The art of embroidery has always given its best efforts
to these church draperies.</p>

<p>Rome was so laden with splendid embroideries by her
eastern conquests, that probably the Christian decorators
would have availed themselves of some of the accumulated
stores; but we have no record of such adaptations,
unless the splendid curtains and the silver hangings of
Pope Stephen IV. were taken out of some imperial
treasure-house.</p>

<p>The contrast between early ecclesiastical art and that
which immediately preceded it in the palaces of the
C&aelig;sars (at Rome, Tivoli, and wherever we find their
ruined glories) is most remarkable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
The lovely and the lively had been suddenly abandoned
for the heavy earnest solemnity and inartistic drawing
of the frescoes of the underground church of St.
Clemente in Rome, and that of the early Christian
mosaics.</p>

<p>It is as if the arts which had lent, nay, given themselves
to the glorification of idols, had suddenly died
out, leaving behind them neither an artist, nor a skilled
artisan, scarcely a tradition.</p>

<p>The new Christian ideas had to be painfully recorded
on sacred buildings and their furnishings for more than
a thousand years; with all the patient acquiescence of
untaught ignorance, and the struggling uncertainty of
genius pursuing a distant glimmering light, apparently
unconscious of all that had preceded it in Egyptian and
classic art. The great political and religious revolutions
in Europe had crushed and buried the arts under the
ruins of the Empire over which Time himself seemed
to have broken his hour-glass, so little was there to show
any memory of their past, or hope for their future. The
alternate progress and destruction of the arts in European
civilization strike the student, in vivid contrast
with the immutability of those of the East, especially in
India and China, where the old forms were still being
maintained by the swaddling bands of codified custom<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
that had restricted their development, but prolonged
their existence, and so they had survived, while Greece
conquered and robbed the East and Egypt, and Rome
crushed Greece and was in her turn despoiled by the
Goths and Huns.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
Christian art had to begin at the very beginning, and
collect its own traditions, and organize its own forms.
These gradually accumulated, availing themselves of
accepted symbols, and adding to them hidden meanings.
The Reformation checked this development in the north
of Europe, but after 300 years we are now witnessing its
revival, which is not merely owing to a religious impulse,
but also to the arch&aelig;ological tendency of our day and
to the historical interest we attach to the ceremonials of
the East.</p>

<p>As the Reformation in Germany was less sweeping and
iconoclastic than our own, we find there many more
remains of ecclesiastical art collected in the churches to
which they have always belonged, or in museums into
which they have drifted;<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> and the Germans have thus been
enabled to do more than even the French, in training
the different schools of work throughout the Continent.</p>

<p>They have proved the Oriental character of the fabrics
employed through the Dark and Middle Ages, i.e. for
about 1400 years, whether they were Syrian, Indo-Chinese,
Indian, Alexandrian, Greek, Sicilian, or Spanish,
or whether they had come from Asia by the north or the
south of Europe. The same traditional forms governed
them all. But an adept is able generally to class and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
name each specimen by the texture of the webs, by the
way gold or gilt thread is inwoven in them, whether the
metal is pure or alloyed, round or flat; also by the mode
of twisting and dyeing the wool, flax, or silk, and its
quality and colouring matter.</p>

<p>Among the earliest historical church embroiderers the
foremost figure is that of the Empress Helena, the
mother of Constantine, claimed in Wales and in the
Welsh ballad of &ldquo;The Dream of Maxen Wledig&rdquo; as
being a Welsh princess married to the Emperor Constans.
She is said to have embroidered an image of the Virgin,
which Muratori speaks of as existing in the Church of
Vercelli in the seventeenth century. Bock says it is
still there, and he quotes an ancient inventory of the
treasures of Phillip the Good, of Burgundy, which names
a &ldquo;Riche et ancienne table d&rsquo;autel de brodeure que on
dit que la premi&egrave;re Emperriez Christienne Fist.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> The
Empress Helena died in the fourth century.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>Then after a long interval comes &ldquo;Berthe aux grands
pieds&rdquo; the mother of Charlemagne, who in the eighth
century was famed for her needlework, which is celebrated
in a poem by Adhelm in the eighth century, quoted by
Mrs. Palliser,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> &ldquo;a ouvrir si com je vous dirai n&rsquo;avoit
meillior ouvriere de Tours jusqu&rsquo;a Cambrai,&rdquo; and her
grand-daughter Gisela followed in her footsteps. Nearly
contemporary, is Aelfled&rsquo;s Durham embroidery,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> described
in the chapter on <a href="#Page_356">English work</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>317]</a></span>
Christian art before the twelfth century is very often
rich, usually picturesque, from its fulness of intention;
sometimes beautiful, when it recalls some echo from the
East, or some tradition of Greek art;<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> but the embroideries
of those centuries are almost always quaint; this is
invariably the archaic phase of all early art. Born in the
catacombs of Rome&mdash;roused by impulses from the
north, by education in the south, and everywhere encouraged
by the fostering hand of the Church, and the
patronage of papal and of royal and imperial houses,&mdash;it
evolved its forms, and emancipated itself at last from its
poor and sordid condition; and the Gothic phase of each
nation attained to its own peculiar growth and characteristics;
and among them the foremost in the world&rsquo;s
estimation was the <a href="#Page_356">English school of embroidery</a>, to
which the next chapter is devoted.</p>

<p>There has been much controversy as to the date of
the dalmatic of Charlemagne in the Vatican treasury.
Like every good early piece of Gothic work in Italy, it is
allotted to the days of Pope Boniface VIII. (thirteenth
century). But when we examine this splendid relic we
cannot doubt that it is of a much earlier time, as there
is nothing Gothic to be found in it. It is full of the
lingering traces of Greek art (not Byzantine). It
reminds us most of the mosaics of Santa Pudenziana,
which are always quoted to prove that Greek art still
survived in Rome in the eighth century.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> The dalmatic
has been much restored, but, I believe, most carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
kept to the old lines. It is worked on a thick, dark-blue,
or purple, satiny silk, which had entirely fallen into little
stripes, but has been skilfully mended, and the embroidery
has never been transferred. On the front is
our Lord in glory, saints below, and angels above, with a
border of children playing, which is truly Greek. The
motive of this is the &ldquo;Ibi et Ubi.&rdquo; On the back is the
Transfiguration, and on the humerals are the sacraments
of bread and wine. The whole, as art, is beautiful; and
it is historically most interesting. Lord Lindsay tells
us that in the dalmatic of Charlemagne, (called that
of Leo III.) Cola di Rienzi robed himself over his
armour, and ascended to the Palace of the Popes after
the manner of the C&aelig;sars, with sounding trumpets before
him, and followed by his horsemen&mdash;his crown on his head
and his truncheon in his hand&mdash;&ldquo;Terribile e fantastico.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>This dalmatic must be ranked first and highest among
ecclesiastical embroideries. (Plates <a href="#pl53">53</a>, <a href="#pl54">54</a>,
<a href="#pl55">55</a>.)</p>

<p>Some of the details are curious. The whole of the
blue satin ground is worked with crosses &ldquo;parsem&eacute;.&rdquo;
Parts of the design are so adorned with larger and smaller
Greek crosses&mdash;and others with the starry cross. On
the shoulder is once embroidered the mystic swastika.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>Signor Galletti, Professor of Embroidery to the Pope,
says it is undoubtedly of the eighth century. It has
been suggested that the design is of the date of the
Exarchate. It is, however, something of infinitely finer
style; it is noble, simple Greek.</p>

<p>Charlemagne&rsquo;s dalmatic is embroidered mostly in
gold&mdash;the draperies in basket-work and laid stitches;
the faces in white silk split-stitch, flat, with finely-drawn
outlines in black silk. The hair, the shadowy part of the
draperies, and the clouds are worked in fine gold and
silver thread with dark outlines. The hands, feet, and
draperies have a fine bas-relief effect. (Plate <a href="#pl53">53</a>,
<a href="#pl54">54</a>, <a href="#pl55">55</a>).</p>

<p>The &ldquo;pluvial of St. Silvester,&rdquo; in the church of St.
John Lateran at Rome, is probably, from its Gothic style,
of the time of Boniface VIII. (thirteenth century).<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> It
never served St. Silvester, except as being perhaps
dedicated to him. On seeing it, one is convinced that
it is English. It has one peculiarity of English Gothic
design in the canopies being supported by twisted pillars
of vine-stems, in this case intersected by green shoots,
and carrying leaves. The angels, the two cherubim
clothed in peacocks&rsquo; feathers, the fine split-stitch, the gold
grounding, and the drawing are also distinctly English.</p>

<p>I give an outline of the pluvial from photographs,<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> and
a finished woodcut of the centre to show the style and
condition of the work. The design is most beautiful, and
we can only regret the loss of the border, which has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>320]</a></span>
been entirely cut off. This shows how elaborate is
the design, yet how artistically arranged as a whole
composition. (Plate <a href="#pl56">56</a>, <a href="#pl57">57</a>.)</p>

<p>It is difficult to settle the precedence between this
splendid piece of church decoration and the rival pluvial
of Bologna in the Museo Civico, said to have come from
the church of San Giacomo. It resembles in style and
execution that of St. Silvester, but its architectural
arrangement contains six circles of subjects, worked like
the other in silk and gold, with gold groundings; and
both are embroidered on linen. On careful examination
of this splendid work of art, I have come to the conclusion
that it is English. (Plate <a href="#pl58">58</a>.)</p>

<p>The Daroca cope (lately belonging to the Arch&aelig;ological
Museum at Madrid) is undoubtedly English.
We can claim it by its peculiar shrine-work, and the
twined columns on the orphreys; by the cherubim, by
the peacock-feathered angels, and by the form of the
panels enclosing the different subjects, from the &ldquo;Life
of Our Lord.&rdquo; (Plate <a href="#pl59">59</a>.)</p>

<p>The cope of Boniface VIII. in the Vatican came from
the church of his native place, Anagni (plate <a href="#pl60">60</a>), where
are still very curious old embroideries (see Hon. and
Rev. I. Clifford&rsquo;s list of embroideries in <a href="#appendix_v">Appendix 5</a>).
Some appear extremely ancient, but there is no sign by
which they may be dated. Some are probably of the
thirteenth century, and are very coarse Italian work, though
finely designed (plate <a href="#pl61">61</a>). There are doubtless many interesting
specimens still to be found in the sacristies of
Italian churches. But they have generally been transferred
to museums.</p>

<p>In the tomb of Walter de Cantilupe (eighteenth century)
at Worcester, were found the remains of a dress which is
decidedly of an earlier date&mdash;evidently of Oriental material,
but Anglo-Saxon work&mdash;so exactly resembling in style that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>321]</a></span>
at Aix given by Bock,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> that we can hardly doubt that
they proceeded from the same workshop, or at least are of
coeval design. Both are worked with a dark red outline
on a red silk ground. The faces and hands are in white
silk&mdash;all the rest between the outlines is gold thread, flat
stitch. Bock places its date as antecedent to the tenth
century, and indeed there is no reason to doubt that this is
correct, though the Worcester fragment was taken out of a
tomb of two centuries later. As these garments were
stored in the church treasuries; and as antiquity (without
an historical interest) was then of no value, these old
clothes, holy by their use and office, yet by their shabbiness
unfit for public show, may have been reverently
disposed of in clothing the bodies of departed priests,
who probably had worn those very vestments, when
officiating at the altar near which they were laid to
rest. When the date of the wearer of the garment is
ascertained, the dress cannot be of a later period, but it
may have belonged to a much earlier one. The architectural
part of these two embroideries, i.e. the canopy
work, resembles that of the Bayeux tapestry. Both
appear to be English. (Plate <a href="#pl62">62</a>.)</p>

<p class="caption">A portion of the Mantle embroidered by Gisela for her husband, St. Stephen of
Hungary. From Bock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kleinodien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the eleventh century, and for some part of the twelfth,
needlework design in England, France, and Germany
first assumed a phase, which may be called the metal-work
style. It is to be found on the robes and mitres of
St. Thomas of Canterbury (Thomas &agrave; Becket) at Sens<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>&mdash;on

gold and pearls at Rheims (which we should incline to
believe is English)<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> (plate <a href="#pl63">63</a>). The fragment of the cope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>322]</a></span>
of William of Blois, found in his tomb, is in this style.
(He died in 1236.) The fragments of this curious garment,
worked in gold on a purple silk material, evidently
Oriental, are also preserved under glass in the Cathedral
Library at Worcester (plate <a href="#pl64">64</a>).</p>

<p>Amongst the finest instances of ecclesiastical needlework,
and, indeed, we may say, of ecclesiastical art of the
twelfth century, is the coronation robe of St. Stephen of
Hungary, decorated by his queen, Gisela,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> which is preserved
in the Imperial Treasury at Ofen (plate <a href="#pl65">65</a>).</p>

<p>Of this authentic historical work we have the whole
story. The original design,<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> drawn on linen, carefully
coloured, is to be seen at the Benedictine convent abbey
of Martinsburg, near Raab in Hungary. The care with
which the work was carried out shows the value then
placed on such undertakings considered as art, and it
has been justified by its survival of 800 years; time
having spared it owing to its perfect materials and
manipulation, till it received cruel injuries by being
carried off and thrown into the bog of Orsava during the
revolution under Kossuth. It was, however, recovered
and restored, and was worn by the present emperor at
the splendid and picturesque ceremonial of his coronation
at Pesth. The design reminds us of the mosaics in the
apse of Santa Maria Maggiore and other churches at
Rome, and it is extremely beautiful. It consists of an
arrangement of medallions and inscriptions, with &ldquo;metal-work&rdquo;
ornaments in bands alternated with smaller medallions.
Yet the figures are not so finely drawn as those
of the Durham relics of the beginning of the tenth century.
The drawing of the figures of the Gisela mantle resembles
those on the garments of Walter de Cantilupe (plate <a href="#pl62">62</a>),
which, from their design and stitches, seem to be of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>323]</a></span>
period. The architectural parts are very like in design
to those of the Bayeux tapestry, though they are infinitely
better, and they have Lombardic characteristics.</p>

<p class="caption">Portion of the Coronation Mantle of Henry II. of Germany, embroidered by the
Empress Kunigunda. From Bock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kleinodien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It appears that Queen Gisela had personally embroidered
this many-figured, richly-embroidered representation
of the &ldquo;Ibi et Ubi&rdquo;&mdash;The Saviour in His glory as
Victor over death and hell, seated on the bow of heaven,
surrounded by choirs of angels and saints, and prophets
of the Old Testament; below on thrones, are the twelve
Apostles. The figures are worked in Oriental gold thread
on Byzantine crimson silk.</p>

<p>In contrast to the Ubi, the heavenly hereafter, the
queen, in the lowest broad hem (border) has represented
the Present, the then &ldquo;Ibi,&rdquo; by the leaders of the Hungarian
magnates and the half-figures of the royal givers
in large gold-embroidered medallions.</p>

<p>The next finest specimen of eleventh century needlework
was the gift of Henry II., Emperor of Germany,
and his wife Kunigunda, to the cathedral of Bamberg,
where it still exists<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> (plate <a href="#pl66">66</a>).</p>

<p>This, again, consists of medallions great and small, of
which the borders, gracefully intertwined, form a large
composition<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> covering the whole surface of the imperial
pallium it once adorned. But in the fifteenth century it
was transferred from its original purple silk ground to
one of dark-blue damask, and altered to the form of a
chasuble, as we see it now. The general design resembles
that of the mantle of Gisela.</p>

<p>Bock calls the style of these works Romanesque;
and he thinks that they show a Saracenic influence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
They appear, however, as I said before, to be rather
Lombardic than anything else. The reader is referred to
Dr. Bock&rsquo;s preface for further lists of Continental works
and workers.</p>

<p>Abb&eacute; Martin considers that in the thirteenth century
the opening out of Gothic art was extended to the laity,
and was really the sign of a great social revolution.
Gothic art had till then only served the Church, and had
been by circumstances closed to the people, who were
yet unfitted, by their want of education, for artistic
life.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>Art was till then almost exclusively produced by the
monastic orders, into which all talent had drifted. But
about this time it fell into the hands of architects and
other originators of design, who presently banded themselves
together into brotherhoods and guilds.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>Embroidery till the thirteenth century had been entirely
in the hands of cloistered women, and the ladies
who practised it learned their craft with the rest of their
education in convents, and their work was simply
ecclesiastical and dedicatory. At that period social
burgher life in the towns had first begun to develope its
love of luxury,<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> and to follow the fashions of other
countries, and the changes of forms in dress and
furnishing which came from foreign parts, though frequently
checked by sumptuary laws. This social movement
preceded everywhere political and religious revolutions.
Embroidery then became customary in lay dress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>325]</a></span>
and lost its religious character, or rather its religious
monopoly.</p>

<p class="caption">The Syon Cope, South Kensington Museum (thirteenth century).</p>

<p>We find that about this time throughout the Church
the forms of ecclesiastical garments were considerably
modified, and made more comfortable for the officiating
priest; and the old traditional trabea was cut down to
the medi&aelig;val chasuble.</p>

<p>English needlework of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries had its own peculiar style of metal-work
pattern, resembling the hinges and spreading central
ornament branching across the wood-work on our church
doors.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>When we meet with this kind of design on foreign
church vestments, we feel inclined always to claim the
merit of them for the English school. The foreign metal-work
patterns are much lighter and more geometrical,
and have not the firmness and at the same time the
fancy that we find in our own of the twelfth century;
and they remind us rather of the goldsmiths&rsquo; than of the
blacksmiths&rsquo; craft. The English embroidery of this style
has the character of &ldquo;appliqu&eacute;,&rdquo; i.e. one material laid
upon another and fastened down.</p>

<p>There are differences of opinion as to the accepted
characteristics of the &ldquo;opus Anglicanum,&rdquo; which in the
twelfth century began to be celebrated.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Some say that
it was principally remarkable for its admixture of jewellers&rsquo;
work in the borders, or the imitation of it in gold thread.
Some give the attempt to reproduce the effect of bas-reliefs
in the embroidered groups of figures; others, again,
point out the peculiarities of the &ldquo;laid stitches&rdquo; in gold,
which so permeated the linen grounding, as to give the
look of a material woven with gold thread. We may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>326]</a></span>
fairly say that <em>all</em> these, which were then ingenious
novelties, combined to give this opus Anglicanum its
value, as well for its beauty as for its ingenuity.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>The Syon cope, (now one of the treasures of art
in the Kensington Museum), is a perfect example of
this work; and is also, according to Bock, &ldquo;one of the
most beautiful among the liturgical vestments of the
olden period anywhere to be found in Christendom.&rdquo;
Dr. Rock&rsquo;s study of this piece of thirteenth century work
in his &ldquo;Catalogue of the Embroideries in the South Kensington
Museum&rdquo; is most interesting, as exemplifying
all the characteristics of the Gothic art of the period,
in its historical, &aelig;sthetic, heraldic, liturgical, emblematical,
and textile aspects. I have ventured to transcribe
the whole of this notice in the <a href="#appendix_vi">Appendix</a>.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> I will
only add here that the one error into which I think he
has fallen, is in naming the stitches. The &ldquo;diapers&rdquo; are
not opus plumarium, but opus pulvinarium, of the class
of &ldquo;laid stitches.&rdquo; This was ascertained by examining
the back of the material under the ancient lining by a
most competent judge<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> in my presence, and so a long-disputed
point is set at rest (plate <a href="#pl67">67</a>).</p>

<p>Ciampini says that in the twelfth century, the arts went
hand in hand, each lending something to the design of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>327]</a></span>
the others. This, however, has always been the
case.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> (Whether they greatly profited by such exchanges
is another question.) I cannot but agree with Semper&rsquo;s
often-reiterated theory, that textile art was a leading
influence and constant suggestion to <em>all</em> art from the
beginning. And the way that ecclesiastical decoration
was so led in the twelfth century is very apparent. In
the new art of stained mosaic glass in church windows
we see the reflex of the flat illuminations and embroideries
of that period; and while these were being influenced
by metal-work, painting was being transferred again to
textile art, pictures being woven as well as embroidered,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
while textiles were seeking to emulate reliefs in a forced
and unnatural manner, more ingenious than artistic.</p>

<p>While England in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
was exciting the admiration of all European artists by
the imitation of bas-reliefs in needlework, by the arrangement
of the light and shadows in the &ldquo;lay&rdquo; of the stitches,
and by a little help from the pressure of hot irons, to
accentuate its apparent indentations, a similar inroad
into the sister art of sculpture, or, perhaps, we should say
a similar adaptation from the sister art, was going on
in Switzerland and Germany, especially in Bavaria.</p>

<p>There was a clever and artistic mode of stuffing and
raising of the important parts of the embroidered design,
such as the figures, the coats-of-arms, or the emblems
of the Passion, &amp;c., in sacred subjects in imitation of
high-relief. There are some beautiful specimens that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span>
have been evidently designed in the School of Cranach.
I will only mention the orphrey, of which the subject is
the &ldquo;Tree of Jesse,&rdquo; exhibited at Zurich, 1883, the
chasuble at Coire in the Grisons, and the little triptych
in the museum of the Wasser-Kirche in Zurich. This
last is exquisitely pretty. The finest, however, is the
altar-piece belonging to Prince Borghese at Rome, which
is certainly German in its design.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>Beautiful as these few examples are, they yet show the
mistake of mixing different forms of art. The designs
are reduced to a compromise between painting, sculpture,
and needlework, which excites interest and perhaps
amusement rather than admiration.</p>

<p>Glass painting, of which we have no notice till the
tenth century, shares many of the rules which hitherto
had applied only to embroideries. It was intended to
give colour and interest to those parts of a building
which otherwise were cold and lifeless. <em>Flatness</em> in the
composition, and the avoidance of pictorial effects
(especially any perspectives) show that it was intended
for conventional decoration, rather than as a rival to
mural painting. There is no doubt that it generally
superseded textile hangings, because it supplied the want
of colour for the large traceried windows just coming into
architectural design, toning down the crudeness of the
masses of light, and tinting the walls and pavements on
which it was cast.</p>

<p>When coloured glass came into general use, embroidered
hangings mostly disappeared. Whatever may have
been the cause, there is no doubt of the coincidence.</p>

<p>The applied embroideries of the north of Germany
were evidently inspired by the newly-discovered art of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
glass-painting, and resemble its designs, both in the
compositions of figures and heraldic subjects. Of
this we may remember examples in the Scandinavian
Exhibition at South Kensington in 1881.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>All the most beautiful and picturesque needlework that
we possess of the true ecclesiastical Gothic type, and
which belongs to the perfect flowering of the art, is of
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, just before the
spirit of the Renaissance crept northward over Europe,
preceding the Reformation and its iconoclastic effacements.
This remark especially applies to England.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
The art of representing Scriptural subjects in flat stitches,
as medallions accompanied by beautiful foliage, and
heraldic designs, is illustrated to us by the palls belonging
to several London companies&mdash;and by those belonging to
churches, especially that of the church at Dunstable, in
which court ladies, knights, and saints form a most
artistic border&mdash;the costumes being of the date of Henry
VII. (see p. <a href="#Page_378">378</a>, <i>post</i>).</p>

<p>The perfection of the embroideries of Flanders of that
period has never been exceeded, and it continues still to
produce the most splendidly executed compositions in
gold and silken needlework, of every variety of stitches.
The Flemish work and its peculiar mode of laying golden
grounds with flat-laid thread stitched down in patterns
was carried into Italy, where great artists did not disdain
to design for textiles. I give, as an instance, Vasari&rsquo;s
account of the embroidered set of vestments designed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>330]</a></span>
Antonio Pollaiolo for the church of San Giovanni at
Florence. These were carried out by Paolo da Verona,
and took twenty-six years for their completion; and
they were only one set of vestments, &ldquo;embroidered by
the most subtle master of the art, Paolo da Verona, a
man most eminent in his calling, and of incomparable
ingenuity (<i>ingenio</i>). The figures are no less admirably
executed with the needle than drawn by Pollaiolo with
the pencil,&mdash;and thus we are largely indebted to one
master for his design, and to the other for his patience&rdquo;
(plate <a href="#pl68">68</a>).</p>

<p>Towards the end of the fifteenth century the Gothic
styles were replaced by the Renaissance, but the technical
part of the art of embroidery for the churches lost none
of its value. All the talent of the artist and the ingenuity
of the craft continued to be lavished on altar decoration
and priestly garments, in Flanders, Spain, France, and
Italy. But the solemnity of these works was certainly
impaired by their being emancipated from the traditional
ecclesiastical forms and their accompanying symbolism,
to which the old designers had so faithfully adhered.
Ecclesiastical decorative art became, so to speak,
unorthodox.</p>

<p>As a proof of this secular, I might almost say irreverent
spirit, I quote Bock&rsquo;s accusation against Queen Mary of
Hungary, who in her embroideries, preserved at Aix-la-Chapelle,
is said to have represented herself as the Queen
of Heaven, surrounded by her adorers on their knees.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, that needlework aspired
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to the highest
place in art, and was enthusiastically cultivated by women
of rank and position, of artistic taste, who still gave
themselves to the productions of beautiful decorations,
though they no longer confined themselves to ecclesiastical
motives.</p>

Gabrielle of Bourbon and Isabella, sister of Louis
XI., spent their lives in preparing and overlooking fine
works in their own apartments, and assembled around
them noble damsels for this purpose. Anne of Brittany,
who lived in an artistic atmosphere, had her own
workshop of embroidery. Pictorial design now asserted
its dominion over needlework, which accepted it, just
as it had been influenced in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries by metal-work motives, and, before then, by
the art of mosaic.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Spanish
pl&acirc;teresque embroideries (adopted and modified in
Flanders and in France), consisting of heavy gold and
silver arabesques of mutilated vegetable forms, superseded
the graceful Renaissance of the classical taste.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
These Spanish embroideries forced their way by their
gorgeousness, in spite of their want of real beauty.
They varied their effects with pearls, corals, and precious
stones<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> (plate <a href="#pl69">69</a>).</p>

<p>Spain, though she was much despoiled during the
Peninsular War by her French invaders, yet still possesses
some of the finest ecclesiastical work in the sacristies of
Seville, Granada, Burgos, Toledo, Segovia, and Barcelona.
Don Juan F. Riano<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> says that Toledo is a perfect
museum of the work of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Sicilian and Neapolitan ecclesiastical needlework
showed the Spanish taste of their masters, but not its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>332]</a></span>
perfection. The use of pearls, coral, and beads<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> prevailed,
and we may in general affix its date and its origin
to each specimen by the silver largely used in the two
kingdoms of Sicily and rarely elsewhere; also by the
extreme brilliancy or rather the gaudiness of its
colouring.</p>

<p>English ecclesiastical work came suddenly to an end at
the Reformation. What was not destroyed is to be found
in the possession of the old Roman Catholic families who
have religiously collected the residue, preserved by
concealment or by being overlooked; and in the wardrobes
of Continental sacristies.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>But the church decorations of France, Germany,
Flanders, Spain, and Italy have meantime, for the last
300 years, gone through all the variations of lay styles,
emanating from anything but ecclesiastical motives. First,
the Renaissance&rsquo;s semi-pagan (so-called) arabesques;
then the Spanish pl&acirc;teresque, which was a revolt against
their own bastard Moorish-Gothic; next, the &ldquo;Louis
Quatorze,&rdquo; followed by the &ldquo;Louis Quinze&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Louis Seize,&rdquo; light, frivolous, and elegant, essentially
social, and not serious.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> Then a return to the classical
of the Empire; and finally, since the beginning of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>333]</a></span>
century, to a conglomerate, lawless imitation of forms and
styles, utterly meaningless and uninteresting, as well as
wanting in ecclesiastical dignity and decorum. We are
glad to believe that we are ourselves striving to reconstruct
some sort of style that shall be able to express poetical and
religious ideas, especially in our church decorations. At
any rate, it must be of some use to understand the hidden
springs which once raised ecclesiastical embroideries,
and especially those of England, so high as objects of
beauty, worthy to adorn the house of God, and to be for
centuries valued as monuments of pious industry and
thoughtful art.</p>

<p>One of these hidden springs and ancient underlying
motives was the symbolism which gave a religious
intention to the smallest design for the humblest use,
provided that its purpose was the service of the
Church.</p>

<p>Sacred symbolism is a subject to which I have alluded
more than once; and it has played such an important
part in the construction and growth of ecclesiastical art,
that I cannot but give a short notice to the subject under
this aspect.</p>

<p>Symbolism in art is what metaphor is in speech. It
is the representation to the eye of an object which
suggests something else besides itself.</p>

<p>Dr. Rock tells us that the symbolism of Scripture texts
was given to the world in a book by St. Melito, Bishop
of Sardis, <small>A.D.</small> 170. Its title is &ldquo;The Key.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> In the
fourth century were produced two great works on Scriptural
symbols, that of St. Basil in his homilies on the six
days of the creation, and that by St. Ambrose; both
entitled Hexameron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>334]</a></span>
We meet this subject at every turn in the succeeding
centuries, till in the twelfth we find it formulated and
divided into branches&mdash;Bestiaria, Volucraria, and Lapidaria&mdash;and
each type had frequently more than one
meaning. Thus a lion represented power, sovereignty,
dominion; also the &ldquo;House of Judah;&rdquo; a hare the
emblem of man&rsquo;s soul; a peacock that of wisdom
(many-eyed). The ruby represents love. The pearl,
innocence. The twelve stones in a breastplate, the
twelve tribes of Israel.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Trees and flowers had also their
symbolical meanings, though we are not aware of their
being recorded in any medi&aelig;val book. We know that the
vine is the tree of life; the stem of Jesse, the sacramental
emblem; that the lily stands for purity, the woodbine for
chastity, and the rose for religious ecstasy. The crowned
lily was always the special emblem of the Virgin.</p>

<p>These symbols had many of them a distant source,
and had been, as I have already indicated, emblematic
of other inner meanings in the expression of pagan faiths.
The tree of life was Babylonian; the horn, Persian; the
fire-sticks of the prehistoric cross, Egyptian or Indian;
and the composite animals representing many qualities,
Ninevite (probably Accadian).<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>All these were utilized, so that their already accepted
uses should be helps and adjuncts, instead of impediments
to the appreciation of divine truths; in the same
way that &ldquo;all that was lovely and of good repute&rdquo; in
the belief and morals of the ancient peoples, reasserted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>335]</a></span>
and purified, was claimed by the new teachers as types
and antitypes. The symbolism of colours has been
always considered very important in liturgical decoration,<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
and their meanings are discussed in the chapter on
<a href="#Page_175">colour</a>.</p>

<p>The mystical colours, as has been already stated, are
five&mdash;red, blue, purple, white, and gold. These the
Christian Church inherited from the Levitical law, and
continued faithful to them till the modern Roman use
introduced green and black. The Church of England
before the Reformation never allowed any but the original
five mystic colours.</p>

<p>The symbolism of ecclesiastical embroideries, as well
as that of all Christian art, being intended to illustrate
the truths of Christianity by the teaching of the eye, the
great symbol of our faith, the <em>Cross</em>, naturally drew to
itself all its prehistoric forms as being the prophetic types
of the &ldquo;true cross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The earliest form of the prehistoric cross, <img src="images/naa02.png" width="70" height="69" alt="Prehistoric cross" />, is
supposed to refer to the worship of the sun, and is said
to be formed of two fire-sticks (for producing fire by
friction) laid across each other. This is almost universal
in prehistoric, archaic, classical, and Christian art to the
thirteenth century. The next most ancient form is a
broken cross, thus, <img src="images/naa03.png" width="70" height="61" alt="Broken cross" />, said to be the double of the
Tau, or Egyptian sign of life, and claimed by the Rabbins
as having been the sign in blood, which stopped the hand
of the angel of death, over the doors of the Israelites at
the first Passover. This afterwards was called the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>336]</a></span>
&ldquo;Gammadion,&rdquo; from its likeness to a doubled Greek gamma,
and it was also said to symbolize the &ldquo;corner-stone.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
The third commonest form, apparently a modification of
that of the fire-sticks, <img src="images/naa04.png" width="70" height="70" alt="Fylfote cross" />, is to be found throughout
Celtic and Scandinavian art, and was called in
England &ldquo;the fylfote&rdquo; (from its likeness to the arms
of the Isle of Man), and likewise &ldquo;the Gammadion,&rdquo;
though it shows another source than the Greek letter.</p>

<p>From these three forms already in use, added to that
of the Crucifixion, endless varieties were composed to
suit the ecclesiastical taste and requirements of different
national styles of symbolical decoration. I refer my
readers to plate <a href="#pl26">26</a> in the chapter on <a href="#Page_82">patterns</a> for a few
of these from different sources. They are extremely suggestive.
I have there entered more fully into the subject,
regarding it as a fertile pattern motive in textile art.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>The cross &ldquo;bearing twelve fruits for the saving of the
nations&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> is so like some of the representations of the
Persian or Indian Tree of Life, that the transmission and
adoption of the symbolic form is evident. The cross
(plate <a href="#pl63">63</a>) is a good medi&aelig;val example, and is taken
from the celebrated rose-coloured cope at Rheims,
embroidered with gold and pearls on a rose-coloured
satin ground.</p>

<p>The Ro&euml;s is an ecclesiastical pattern of wide use and
of very long descent, often named in ancient Church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>337]</a></span>
inventories. It is sometimes called the &ldquo;Wheel and
Plate.&rdquo; Its origin is probably Oriental, but it certainly
was adopted by the Romans as the motive of their
triumphal garments, the <i>tog&aelig; pict&aelig;</i>, worn in the processional
return of a conqueror, whether he were a general
or a sovereign. The first motive was a surface covered
with circles, closely touching each other, and containing
figures which had a reference to their purpose. In
Christian times the heads of saints were sometimes inserted,
especially in that form of the Ro&euml;s called the
chrysoclavus, from the intersticial ornament between the
circles.</p>

<p>I have written (p. <a href="#Page_308">308-9</a>) about the Trabea, which on
the Roman consular ivory diptychs of several centuries
is so invariably embroidered with this same clavus
pattern (plate <a href="#pl70">70</a>) that we must conclude that it had a
meaning and a tradition.</p>

<p>The very ancient superstition that driving in a nail is a
fortunate rite, may have been connected with the pattern
called the clavus; and the chrysoclavus, from being
merely a nail pattern, became consecrated in Christian
art as representing the heads of the nails of the
Crucifixion, and hence its early Christian name.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> It was
originally filled in with a radiated ornament like the
sun; (probably the first motive of this pattern, which
seems to be the same as the Egyptian sun-cross,) and
its peculiar decoration remained in possession of the
descriptive name &ldquo;palmated,&rdquo; though it is difficult to
discover in it any likeness to the palm branch or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>338]</a></span>
tree, unless it is supposed to resemble it as seen from
above.</p>

<p>The toga triumphalis was also called the toga picta,
because its precious purple fabric was covered with
gorgeous embroideries. After it had been worn at the
triumph or festival, by the victorious general, the distinguished
noble, or the Emperor, it was laid by and
dedicated in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Thus
these palmated triumphal patterns, and their traditional
decorations, having by their dedication to the gods
assumed a religious character, were woven for Christian
ecclesiastical use during the dark ages, and were repeated
in Sicily and Spain down to the beginning of the fifteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>I have elsewhere spoken of the &ldquo;cloud pattern,&rdquo; which
is very ancient, Chinese, Indian, and medi&aelig;val. Its use
has always been for celestial subjects in embroidery, either
isolating or supporting spiritual figures. This was appropriated
by ecclesiastical art, and we find it nowhere else
in Europe.</p>

<p>This sketch of the history of ecclesiastical needlework,
(necessarily incomplete from want of space), is founded
on the works of Semper, Bock, Rock, and the comparison
of many specimens in collections and exhibitions
in London and elsewhere. Auberville absolutely places
before us the materials as well as the patterns of the
weaving of the Christian era, as well as fragments of
Egyptian textiles, in his beautiful book on Tissues.</p>

<p>For forms and patterns we cannot do better than study
Bock&rsquo;s liturgical chapters and their illustrations, as well
as Dr. Rock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Church of our Fathers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stitchery of Christian art has been discussed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>339]</a></span>
in the chapter on <a href="#Page_194">stitches</a>, and I repeat that there is
nothing new in the treatment of solid embroideries, (lace
stitches having been the only innovation of the last 400
years), though many of the ancient stitches have lost
their distinctiveness, and fallen into a pitiful style by
gradual descent which reached its lowest point in the
early part of this century, as is shown by the robes
embroidered for the coronation of Charles X. in the
museum of the Louvre.</p>

<p>In the commencement of this our nineteenth century,
there was a total cessation of embroidery, which had, for
nearly 2000 years held its own as an art, apart from
all others; perhaps a secondary one&mdash;yet mixed up with
every refinement and luxury of civilization.</p>

<p>Its revival in England, especially, is owing to many
causes. As ecclesiastical decoration I have already
attributed it to the arch&aelig;ological tendencies of our day,
as well as to the &aelig;sthetic sentiment which protests, after
so long a period of abstention, against the puritanical
bareness and coldness of our national forms of worship.
The obliteration of embroidery from the list of the arts
was more complete in England than elsewhere; as the
church of Rome still continued to be adorned with
beautiful work on altar-cloths and frontals, and priest&rsquo;s
dresses, which, though too much regulated in design by
the lay tastes and fashions of the time, have combined
to keep up a traditional school of needlework throughout
the Continent.</p>

<p>Exhibitions abroad and at home have shown us what
a latent power in art embroidery still preserves, and
architects have employed the women&rsquo;s needles to give
colour and beauty to the decaying churches, which have
been restored to their original architectural effects by
careful copies of what remained in wood, stone, and
glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>340]</a></span>
The number of new churches has also given rise to the
production, in more than one semi-conventual establishment,
of beautiful and effective works, such as the altar-cloth
at Durham, and those at Canterbury and Worcester.
Such works have revived the impulse of artistic and
ecclesiastical taste, and in many small churches we have
seen beautifully embroidered altar decorations.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>There are, however, many amateurs who are perhaps
mistresses of the craft of needlework, and who are yet
not educated sufficiently to design a really thoughtful and
beautiful work of art, and to these a few remarks may be
addressed, which may help the struggling aspirants, and
show them how they fail, and where to seek for assistance.</p>

<p>I shall begin by pleading for more careful design, and
less parsimony in expenditure upon the usual church
adornments. It is once more a received dogma in
ecclesiastical art, one in which all religious opinions
agree, that the building in the parish which is set apart
for the first public duty, that of worship, should show as
much beauty as the means and taste of the community
can command.</p>

<p>Perhaps the little church has just been restored, or
completely rebuilt from the foundations; the consecration
is imminent. The white stone, carved or plain, shines
fresh and cold, and the whole space looks poor and bare.</p>

<p>The rich woman of the neighbourhood sees and feels
that colour is wanting (for the windows must wait till
their use as pious memorials fills them with glowing
tints). The central point of the whole edifice, the altar,
calls for the first key-note in colour to be struck, and a
splendid altar-cloth is the fitting instrument.</p>

<p>She consults the architect, who probably is also an
artist, and the design is agreed upon, and hurriedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>341]</a></span>
drawn and carried out; for there is not a moment to lose
if it is to be ready for the opening day. It may be
beautiful, and it sometimes is so, but the mere want of
time for due consideration often results in the commonplace
ornamentation, which neither satisfies the eye nor
the mind. It is often only a mere bit of colour and a
medi&aelig;val pattern, and has no apparent motive or meaning
to give it value.</p>

<p>One sometimes finds that a conventional form has
been selected, of which the emblematic intention it
originally expressed has been forgotten or overlooked.
Therefore, while to the unlearned it conveys no meaning,
it is read as absolute nonsense by the ecclesiastical
arch&aelig;ologist, simply because it is worked in a language
of undeciphered hieroglyphics&mdash;unknown to the worker&mdash;meaningless,
reminding us of the Gr&aelig;co-Egyptian
inscriptions, of which the pictured words seem to have
been copied at random for their prettiness, or the Arabian
lettering on some of the ancient Sicilian textiles, which is
nonsense. The sense and the emblematic meaning are
forgotten, and the conventional form&mdash;an empty shell&mdash;is
alone retained, conveying no idea, and reduced to
the low purpose of being a pretty pattern, vague and
unintelligent.</p>

<p>I have so often said that a pattern always originally
possessed, and should always retain a meaning, that I
fear to become tiresome; but I repeat it here, as in
ecclesiastical design it is more important than elsewhere;
the meanings are deeper, and convey more essentially
solemn traditions and allusions. If the motive of the
designer is evident, and is conscientiously worked out,
its value receives an enduring quality, and its present
interest is enhanced.</p>

<p>Embroidery is not less eloquent than her sister-arts in
the teaching of divine lessons, and appealing through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>342]</a></span>
beauty of form and colour to the poetical instincts of the
congregation, of which the least educated members
almost unconsciously feel the influence; and besides, the
people are always alive to the charms of symbolism, when
it is placed within their reach. As a proof of this, among
our own peasantry and mechanics, I would point to their
universal enjoyment of the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the symbolism of art, the thoughts which are
individual to the artist can only be expressed by known
forms and colours, even as the poet must employ the
words and the metres already accepted by the literature
of his language.</p>

<p>Hurry is fatal to art. But another and very serious
cause of its deterioration is its costliness.</p>

<p>In the dark and medi&aelig;val ages, time was of no
account. Skilled labour, such as was needed for carving,
illuminations, and embroideries, was freely given as the
duty of a life, for one particular object, the good of a
man&rsquo;s soul. The cloistered men and women worked for
no wages; neither to benefit themselves nor their descendants;
hardly for fame,&mdash;that was given to the convent
which had the credit of patronizing and producing art,<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
while the very name of the artist was forgotten.</p>

<p>It was from pure love of the art as a craft, and the
belief that it was a good work in which they were engaged,
and from their abundant leisure, that they were enabled
to evolve the lovely creations which delight and astonish
us when shown in the sacristies and treasuries of foreign
religious houses and churches, where they have been
cherished for centuries. Like the silkworm they spent
themselves; and by their industrious lives were surrounded
in their living graves by the elaborated essence
of their own natures, a joy and consolation to themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>343]</a></span>
and a legacy to all time. To them, also, art appeared as
the consoler.</p>

<p>But to return to the grievances of to-day&mdash;cheapness
and hurry, economy of pence and hours&mdash;these often
are the bane of the work which we give to the Church,
sometimes as a memorial, sometimes as a thank-offering.
The colours are bad, because cheap dyes fade, and
none others can be had without much trouble, and we
have only time to select among those that are for sale.
The work is poor because it must be done quickly, and
we cannot afford to delay and pay for the extra hours
necessary to make the stitches worthy and capable of
lasting. Possibly we cannot give the time ourselves, nor
can find any one effectually to organize and overlook the
work.</p>

<p>Though the design, the motive, the colours and
materials, as well as the stitches, need to be each carefully
studied, yet we perhaps accept an ancient drawing
intended for a different place and use; and thus we fail
to produce any effect, with uncongenial surroundings.
Sometimes we feel obliged to take the design forced upon
us by a shopwoman as ignorant as ourselves, with the
submissive hope &ldquo;that it will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now to a truly artistic mind it would appear that each
little church, however simple and devoid of ornament,
requires its own special colours and design, besides the
individual motive of the giver; and people forget that
the whole effect in any such compositions must be comprehensive,
and that one careless mistake spoils all.</p>

<p>The High Church, in its love of ritualistic vestments,
has sometimes been prejudicial to the general adoption
of properly studied altar decorations; as there is a
common suspicion that a clergyman&rsquo;s personal wish for
ornament, akin to a woman&rsquo;s addiction to fine clothes,
governs all his attempts to adorn the altar; whereas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>344]</a></span>
there should be, and there often is, a real artistic feeling
for the fitness of things, in the furnishings of the
most beautiful building set aside by the community for
the glory of God. But it is not necessary for beautiful
effects that there should be any coloured vestments.
When the clergy are duly robed in the orthodox surplice
and scarves, there is, perhaps, something funereal in the
white linens and black Geneva silk, but yet the traditional
white and black have their own value against a background
of altar-cloth and reredos splendidly coloured.</p>

<p>Now that, in spite of prejudice, church decoration is so
much the custom of our day, it is worth our while to
consider seriously how best to carry it out, and search
into the principles which may apply to all ecclesiastical
embroideries, whether they are to be dedicated in the
Minster, the village Church, or the home Chapel.</p>

<p>We must begin by remembering that in these days, if
we cannot do the work ourselves, it must be highly paid
for. The skilled artisan who is no artist, receives enough
to feed his family, according to the higher wages of the
time. The woman&rsquo;s slow stitchery has to support probably
as many claims, and yet it is always grudged as
being too costly. The sculptor or the painter who succeeds
in obtaining employment, is highly paid, but the
designer for metal-work or embroideries occupies an
unrecognized place in art, and barely earns enough to
live by. The illuminator has ceased to exist; he would
starve&mdash;probably has been starved out long ago.</p>

<p>The decorative designer, having, therefore, no status,
has no education; and it is almost impossible to find
in England an artist to accept orders for thoughtful
ecclesiastical designs. Hundreds of boys and girls are
taught &ldquo;freehand drawing,&rdquo; and having copied some
casts and lithographs and drawn some flower-pieces,
without any particular aim, find a precarious living by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>345]</a></span>
designing frightful wall-papers for the million. These
poor creatures, from whose lives all ambition and originality
have been effaced, are our decorative artists.</p>

<p>Still a beautiful original design can sometimes be
obtained, and if that is beyond our reach, we may
courageously copy from ancient models, selecting judiciously
what is most suitable for our purpose.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical artist should be well informed in the
modes of working a design. The stitch if selected
without experience may mar the effect of the whole
composition, as some stitches of themselves convey the
meaning of shadow, and others that of light.</p>

<p>In ecclesiastical work which is intended to be effective
in the distance, as well as perfect in detail, it is worth
while to weigh the claims of the architectural low-relief
motive, i.e. a flat raised surface, with an edge sufficiently
accentuated to catch a light on one side, and cast a sharp
shadow on the other. All flat <em>raised</em> stitches conduce
also to this effect, especially if edged with a cord, and it
is much more striking than in stuffed work (on the
stamp), which has not the incisive effect that is given
by the tool to the sharp edge of stone or wood carvings.</p>

<p>If we can afford to give to our church without stint,
let us seek for the most beautiful textiles, such as are
again woven in imitation of the old fabrics; gratefully
acknowledging all that Pugin, Ruskin, and the foreign
manufacturers, especially those at Lyons, have done in
the revival of woven designs. Let us avoid those
materials which are easily spoiled by sunshine, dust, and
smoke, and all those that fray easily. Woollens are not
long lived. Crewels, beautiful as they are, are not
salient in their effect. Silks, satins and velvet, and gold
brocades,<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> or groundings worked in with gold thread, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>346]</a></span>
the only materials worthy of bearing fine embroidery, fit
to receive them, and capable of keeping them for
centuries. Plushes and worsted velvets are unworthy,
indeed they are worthless.</p>

<p>The gold we employ must be either pure &ldquo;passing,&rdquo;
or else the Chinese or Japanese gold threads which differ
in colour, but have each their own value, and never
tarnish, even in the coal smoke of London. Pure silver,
too, is beautiful, and if it is really pure, can be kept bright
with bread crumbs.</p>

<p>In composing the altar decoration for the cathedral or
the village church, we ought to take into consideration
what is suitable for the surrounding architecture. In
great spaces, the majestic altar-cloth or frontal, shining
with gold and silver, and glowing with silken embroideries,
recalls the splendid altar &ldquo;palli&rdquo; encrusted with
gems in St. Mark&rsquo;s, St. Peter&rsquo;s, and other ancient
churches; and is in perfect keeping with the high and
gorgeous reredos, the rich screen, the fretted roof and
clustered ornaments of a great cathedral choir. Such
glories are unattainable in the modest village church.</p>

<p>But though we may subdue the brilliancy of our
decoration, we should try to make it yet a work of art.
The design may have as much intention, the work be as
refined and individual, and the gold as pure, as in larger
works. The precious metals may be confined to small
spaces in the parts we desire to accentuate, such as the
cross in the centre, or the edges of the orphreys, or they
may be entirely replaced with fine silk work.</p>

<p>The altar-cloth we desire to present, may be simply a
gift, so that we may choose any design that will agree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>347]</a></span>
with the date of the building. We may prefer any subsequent
style, but not one anterior to that of the architecture.
It would be a mistake to imitate Anglo-Saxon
ornaments in a church of the flamboyant style.</p>

<p>Perhaps the altar-cloth we are discussing may be intended
as a sort of votive offering, a memorial of a
baptism, a wedding, or a funeral.</p>

<p>For the first, white silk worked in gold and silver, or
gold-coloured silk, or parsem&eacute; with conventional spring
flowers would be appropriate. For a marriage, crimson,
rose-colour, blue and gold, or a mixture of all these, to
produce a festive and gorgeous effect. For a funeral,
purple or violet silk or velvet, with palms and the crown
of thorns in gold or silver.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> These would serve at the
festivals of the Church: the purple for Good Friday,<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
the crimson for Saints&rsquo; days, the white for Christmas and
Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>The reredos, or the screen curtain behind the altar,
should be made available for enhancing its effect, as
well as for enlarging the area of textile coloured decoration.</p>

<p>As this is intended for a background, it should be
either subdued or else contrasting, in juxtaposition with
that which it is intended to supplement. Woollen embroideries
or tapestries are the most usually selected for
this purpose. The softness of fine crewels is well
shown near the more glowing tints of silk, velvet, and
gold of the altar frontal. If this is white, or light
coloured, the reredos hanging should be of dark or richly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>348]</a></span>
worked material; if the frontal is dark, the contrast should
be preserved by hangings of tender shades.</p>

<p>The pulpit and reading-desk, with their small cushions
and veils, and beautiful worked covers for the books,
give opportunities for repetition of colour which is often
required for picturesque effect.</p>

<p>I should recommend the young ecclesiastical designer
to study the principles which guided the authors
of some of the fine Gothic examples remaining to us,
such as the great Stoneyhurst cope, and the palls of the
different London companies, as well as the very few fine
altar-cloths still existing. All these have their brilliant
and effective treatment; they are intended to be glorious,
and either represent massive jewellers&rsquo; work or tissues
of wrought gold.</p>

<p>Anciently, the ornaments for the different church
services, which we timidly reduce to floral decorations
(often, however, very beautifully planned and executed),
gave the opportunity for displaying costly embroidered
hangings.</p>

<p>The paschal of the choir of Durham, for example, was
a marvellous construction of wood and gilding, metal-work,
and (probably) hangings. It was as wide as the
&ldquo;lateral&rdquo; of the choir, and as high as the building, so
that the central and seventh candlestick (that from
which the new fire for the year was kindled) was so near
the roof that there was a &ldquo;fine convenience through the
said roof of the church for the help of lighting it.&rdquo; I
quote from a rare book printed by G. S. Ross for
Mrs. Waghorn, 1733.</p>

<p>This little book is full of interesting matter regarding
Durham Cathedral, though the author is most concerned
in relating the vandalisms committed by the dean&rsquo;s wife,
Mrs. Whittinghame, who evidently had &ldquo;no culture,&rdquo; and
a strong turn for appropriating odds and ends, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>349]</a></span>
tombstones, embroidered silk, and other curiosities which
she deemed valueless except for her own purposes,&mdash;such
a woman is a real arch&aelig;ological misfortune!</p>

<p>The corporax used in celebrating the mass by St.
Cuthbert in the seventh century (he died and was buried
at Holy Isle in 657) was supposed to be endowed with
miraculous powers and was carried into battle on many
occasions as a banner.</p>

<p>This banner was of crimson velvet on both sides,
wrought with flowers in green silk and gold, and fringed
with red silk and gold. The corporax cloth was inserted
in the centre, and covered with a square of white velvet,
having on it a cross of red velvet, &ldquo;most artificially worked
and fringed, with little silver bells in the fringe.&rdquo; This
was carried into battle, till Dame Whittinghame &ldquo;did most
injuriously destroy the same in her fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One feels as if this woman were spiteful, as well as
stupid. But for her punishment, her memory is kept
quite the contrary to green by Mrs. Waghorn&rsquo;s careful
record of her iniquities; which has at the same time
fortunately preserved to us the description of the banner
of St. Cuthbert, and gives also an idea of &ldquo;the good and
sumptuous furniture of changeable suits,&rdquo; and of &ldquo;the
divers vestments wrought and set round about with pearls,
both stoles and flannels, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking at it from a distance, it appears that the &ldquo;fair
white linen&rdquo; for the communion service always requires
the softening of the edges by fringes, by cut work
embroidery, or by thick lace edgings. If a white ground
for embroidery is required, nothing is more beautiful than
linen, especially if it is not over-bleached. White, in art,
should be represented by the nearest approach to no
colour; but it is more agreeable to the eye by its being
tempered with a suggestion of the natural tint, of which
all textile substances possess something (excepting cotton)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>350]</a></span>
before they have passed through the hands of the fuller
or the chemist.</p>

<p>Corporals and veils for the pyx used to be of white
linen, embroidered with white silk or linen thread; the
silk gives a beautiful, varied, shining brightness.</p>

<p>I think a few words should be said about the fringe.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
Its motive and <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> is the disposal of the threads
of the warp when it is cut out of the frame; these being
tied and knotted symmetrically, become an artistic
decoration instead of an untidy tangle of threads and
thrums. Edging the material and finishing it with its
own loose ends is a very ancient custom; and we can
see from the sculptures of Nineveh that they were great
in that city in the art of fringe-making, and the Israelites,
when they made their hangings for the sanctuary,
trimmed them with fringes. It stands to reason that an
added fringe should be arranged with reference to the
origin of the decoration, and the moment we think of it,
the eye is annoyed by seeing a deep fringe of one or two
colours traversing the whole widths of the frontal and
super-frontal, quite irrelevantly, and without any reference
to the masses of colours, woven or embroidered, above
them; and the consequence of this carelessness is, that
it makes it look as if this part of the decoration, came
from another source, independent of the composition which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>351]</a></span>
it ought to supplement. The fringe should belong to the
whole design, and be carefully fitted to the spaces occupied
by the colours above it, each of its compartments or
divisions being filled in with those tints which are most
conspicuous in the general design and would show
effectively in the warp. It is not necessary to account
for all the colours, as the threads employed to form the
woof would naturally disappear at the sides of the web.
The sections of the fringe should be skilfully arranged so
as to reappear at equal distances, or at least they should be
so balanced as to produce that effect. If this is impossible,
the fringe should be all of one shade, matching exactly
the ground of the textile. It may be relieved by
clustered knobs, or hanging beads or cups of different
colours and gold. The celebrated pluvial at Aix-la-Chapelle
has a fringe of gold bells hanging to a gold
cord, which amalgamates with the pattern.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> The veils of
the Sanctuary in the wilderness were fringed with
attached ornaments, bells, blossoms, knops, flowers, and
fruit, which sounds extremely pretty.</p>

<p>To resume, let me once more urge that in church
work neither time nor trouble be spared; nor yet
money grudged, if possible. The design should be
full of intention, the stitching perfect, and the materials
most carefully chosen for tints, for endurance and
smoothness. Remember that no inferior substitute will
serve to give present effect, nor will it last into the future.</p>

<p>Design, as I have elsewhere said, is all the better for
being to a certain degree circumscribed, relegated, and
regulated by the laws of traditional usage, as well as
those of good taste, and this applies especially to ecclesiastical
design.</p>

<p>These laws serve as the frame which encloses the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>352]</a></span>
motive thought, and makes it a complete whole, that can
admit of no amplifications.</p>

<p>New symbols should not be adopted except for the
expression of new facts or altered circumstances, and
these can but seldom enter into liturgical art.</p>

<p>There is so much already formulated and admitted,
and the area in which we may gather our materials is so
large, that we need not seek for more than we find under
our hand, ready for use.</p>

<p>Besides the symbolism of dogma, we have all the
heraldry of the Saints; and can repeat and vary the emblems
of those to whom the church we are working for is
dedicated. The keys of St. Peter, the sword of St. Paul,
the lilies of the Virgin, the cross of St. Andrew, the eagle
of St. John,&mdash;I need hardly enumerate all these legitimate
sources of decoration. Then there is the lay heraldry
which belongs to the history of each church, and which
memorializes the reign of the monarch when it was begun,
finished, or restored, and the pious work and care of the
founder and benefactor, the architect, and sometimes
that of the sculptor.</p>

<p>Now as our forefathers accepted all this material for
ecclesiastical design, remodelling it to their own uses in
different centuries, so we cannot ourselves do better than
imitate them, and profit by their experience; never
missing an opportunity of studying ancient embroideries;
and while we admire in them all that is admirable, and
appreciate their historical and arch&aelig;ological value, we may
yet extract greater benefit for ourselves, by criticizing
what is imperfect, as well as what is possibly a descent
and failure from a higher type.</p>

<p>We must make a judicious selection of what to imitate
and what to avoid.</p>

<p>As a general rule, I should warn the young artist
against the imitation of &ldquo;na&iuml;vet&eacute;&rdquo; and so-called &ldquo;quaintness;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>353]</a></span>
especially in our designs for Church embroidery
as it is hardly a noble quality in art, though we look on
it with a tender pity, half-way between admiration and
contempt, when we find it inevitably in medi&aelig;val work;
struggling to overcome the expression of something
difficult, and expressing a difficulty only partly overcome.
We find ourselves putting our minds into the attitude of
the artist who conceived those figures with arms conventionally
growing out of the encasing garment; conventionally
holding a book, and giving a blessing with
a conventional twist, not entirely ungraceful, nor devoid
of a certain dignity, rather felt than perceived. Yet we
contemplate them with a smile of conscious superiority,
appreciating our own refined sense of their merits and
infantine progress towards something good, that time&mdash;a
long time&mdash;would, and did evolve. But those efforts
at last culminated in a Christian art, such as is seen
in the splendid forms and adornments in stone, gold,
silver, glass, and embroideries of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries. Such splendours as the windows
of Bourges, the Sainte-Chapelle at Paris, or those of the
Cathedral of Toledo, or King&rsquo;s College Chapel at Cambridge.
Such sculptures and traceries as those of the
Puits de Moise at Dijon, and the Chapter House at
Southwell in Nottinghamshire. Such embroideries as
the Syon cope, and the Borghese triptych. These are
types worthy of all praise, and they are full of instruction
to the student of ecclesiastical art.</p>

<p>The Kensington Museum offers us endless help and
suggestions in its very interesting collection of liturgical
vestments of every date and school; and its textiles,
illustrated by the inventory of their learned collector, Dr.
Rock, are most instructive.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>354]</a></span>
In the library of that museum are to be found many
of the learned works on these subjects by French and
German <i>savants</i>. The exhibitions in the English counties
are never without a case or a room full of embroideries,
collected from the treasure-chests of the neighbouring
churches and country houses, and especially from those
of the ancient Roman Catholic families. The colleges
of Oscott and Stoneyhurst have collected, by purchase
or by gift, many fine relics of the craft, which are most
liberally granted for exhibition.</p>

<p>For those who can go further afield there is instruction
in almost every Continental town. Rome, Florence, Milan,
Toledo, Sens, Rheims, Aix-la-Chapelle, Berne, Vienna,
Halberstadt, Berlin, and Munich&mdash;each and all have stores
of beautiful liturgical objects carefully preserved; of many
dates, and many styles, and showing endless varieties of
design, which can be employed on new works by careful
selection and adaptation. Most of these belong to the
eleventh and succeeding centuries; any earlier examples
are fragmentary, and have generally been taken from the
tombs of kings and bishops.</p>

<p>It seems to savour of desecration, this opening of
shrines and disturbing the ashes of the illustrious dead, if
only for the satisfaction of arch&aelig;ological curiosity. But
except where it has hitherto been protected by the
sanctity of the tomb, there is so little that remains to us,&mdash;so
few textiles have survived the friction of use, or even
that of the air, through as many as a thousand years or
more, that we may plead the hunger for truth, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>355]</a></span>
eager desire for proofs of identity and verification of historical
legends, which are to be extracted from the
shape of a garment, from the pattern on the border, or
the lettering on the web of which it is composed; whence
we reverently cut a fragment, and preserve it under
glass.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter, I would wish to observe
that I have entered into the subject of church decoration
in no ritualistic spirit; I do not treat it theologically, but
as art; and if these decorations are to be carried out at
all, I feel that I am rendering a service to those whose
duty or pleasure it is to provide them, by pointing out
where they may find the principles which have been the
spring and life of medi&aelig;val art, and the survivals which
are now the best exponents of those principles to guide
us in the works of our day.</p>

Figure-drawing in early Christian art was for nearly a thousand years
primitively barbarous, with occasional exceptions. The rapid decline in
Europe, through the art of the Catacombs and St. Clemente at Rome,
and the frescoes and mosaics of Ravenna, down to the Bayeux tapestries,
is very remarkable. In those inartistic compositions during the early
Middle Ages, the figures were drawn facing the spectator, the head and feet
in profile, differing in nothing from the Egyptian and Assyrian modes of
representation. We can hardly account for this return to childish ways,
from which Greece and Rome had so long been emancipated, except
by supposing that they came from the imitations of Oriental textiles,
which still retained very ancient forms; for instance, the motive of the
sculptured lions over the gate of Mycen&aelig;. We cannot say that Greek

Till very lately we have been entirely dependent on the frescoes in
the Catacombs and in the underground Church of St. Clemente at Rome,
and on monumental art and illuminations, for our knowledge of the
textiles of the earliest days of Christianity. But Herr Graf&rsquo;schen&rsquo;s
discoveries in Egypt will, when published, add greatly to our information
on this subject.</p>

The book by Parker on the &ldquo;Liturgical Use&rdquo; says that only the
five liturgical colours were permitted in the use of the Church of
England. Before the Reformation the Norman and English liturgical
colours were different. (Rock, &ldquo;Church of our Fathers,&rdquo; ii. p. 268.)
Perhaps nothing was originally worked departing from this rule, but
votive offerings are inventoried as being of all colours, having been
accepted and used as decoration and for vestments.</p>

I have already spoken of the custom of clothing the images of the
gods as a classical tradition. The Greeks draped their statues in
precious garments, often the spoils of subjugated nations, offerings
from the conquerors, or obsequious tribute from the conquered. Newton
(<a href="#appendix_i">Appendix 1</a>) tells us of inscriptions containing inventories of old clothes
offered in the Greek Temples. Ezekiel (xvi.) speaks of silk and linen
embroideries given for covering the idols. The images of the saints in
Roman Catholic churches are, we know, constantly draped in splendid
embroideries, and hung with jewels.</p>

Charlemagne&rsquo;s dalmatic, described hereafter, of which the pedigree

The information here collected proves that these sovereign gifts
to the great basilicas were by no means of costly materials, especially
as compared with the preceding splendours of Rome, or the still more
astounding luxury of Alexandria through the Greek conquests of the
Eastern nations. To these rules of economical decoration, however,
we find occasionally exceptions. We gather also from later lists that
the embroideries of the Papal See were culled, in the thirteenth
century, from France, Spain, Germany, and England.</p>

man struggling with the dominion of sin. However, Bock considers
the design to have been originally classical Greek, and it survived to
the seventh and eighth centuries, and was reproduced as late as the

The collections of needlework in Germany are very rich. The
treasury of the cathedral at Halberstadt, the Markt-Kirche of Brunswick,
the sacristy of the Marien-Kirche of Dantzic, and that of the
Kaland Brethren at Strahlsund are especially quoted by Bock. At
Quedlinburg are the tapestries of its famous abbess; at the Pilgrim
Church of Marie at Zell are fine remains of stuffs and embroideries by
the ladies of the imperial house of Hapsburg, of the thirteenth century;
at the Abbey of G&ouml;ss (near Lieben, Steiermark) is to be seen the
remarkable needlework of the Abbess Kunigunda, and in the cathedral
treasury of Heidelberg the antipendium of the fourteenth century,
made for the church at Tirna. The museums of Berlin, Munich, and

At Aachen, in Switzerland, there is a very remarkable pluvial of
one kind of opus Anglicanum, which has been already alluded to. The
border, of splendid gold embroidery, has the pattern completed in
fine flowers of jewellers&rsquo; work. (See Bock, &ldquo;Liturgische Gew&auml;nder,&rdquo;

Alban&rsquo;s Abbey by Margaret, Duchess of Clarence, <small>A.D.</small> 1429, as being
remarkable for pure gold in its texture and the splendour of the
jewels and precious stones set into it, as well as for the exquisite

opus Anglicanum.</p>

If it is true that in the days of the Greeks and Romans the art of
acupictura or needle-painting copied pictorial art, so likewise in the
Egyptian early times, painted linens imitated embroideries. This we
learn by specimens from the tombs. Painted hangings and embroideries
appear to have been equally used for processional decorations. In the
Middle Ages painted hangings imitated embroideries and woven
hangings, and were considered as legitimate art.</p>

in painted glass as early as the ninth and tenth centuries in France and
Germany (&ldquo;History of Painting,&rdquo; vol. i. pp. 316-339). They remark
that the character of painted glass is nearly akin to textile decoration,
that it is essentially flat and unpictorial. And doubtless there is an
analogy between the two, but rather suggesting patchwork or cut work
than legitimate embroidery.</p>

most ancient descent. In the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford is an
illuminated copy of Philip de Than&rsquo;s Bestiarium, composed for Adelais,
second wife of Henry I.</p>

Under the Carlovingians, priestly garments were often enriched
with splendid fringes, trimmed with bells. A Bishop of Elne, who died
in 915, left to his church a stole embroidered with gold and garnished
with bells. So rich were the fringes at that epoch, that King Robert,
praying one day in the church, became aware that while he was lost in
meditation a thief had ripped off part of the fringes of his mantle. He
interrupted his proceedings by saying, &ldquo;My friend, suppose you content
yourself with what you have taken, and leave the rest for some other
member of your guild.&rdquo; See &ldquo;Histoire du Tissu Ancien,&rdquo; Union
Central des Arts D&eacute;coratifs. For a fringe with bells, see the beautiful

reckless exposure to floods of sunshine even when they are protected

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>ENGLISH EMBROIDERY.</h3>


<p>Through the preceding chapters I have tried to
moderate my predominant interest in our national school
of needlework, seeking to place it in its just position alongside
of the coeval Continental schools. However, the
more I have seen of specimens at home and abroad, the
more I have become convinced of the great superiority
of our needlework in the Middle Ages. As information
about our own art must be valuable to us, I give a short
account of English embroidery.</p>

<p>In England our art, like our language, is mixed. Our
early history is one of repeated conquest, and we can
only observe where style has flowed in from outside, or
has formed itself by grafting upon the stem full of
vitality already planted and growing. It is interesting
to seek its root.</p>

<p>There is every reason to believe, from the evidence of
the animal remains of the Neolithic Age (including those
of sheep), that they came with their masters from the
central plateau of Asia.</p>

<p>The overlap of the Asiatic civilizations over the barbarism
of Northern Europe shows that Assyria<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>357]</a></span>
as Egypt was a highly organized empire, and the Mediterranean
peoples far advanced in the arts of life, while
the Neolithic man survived and lingered in Britain,
France, and Scandinavia. Yet, even at that early period,
the craft of spinning and the use of the needle were
practised by the women of Britain.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>Our first glimpses of art may have come to us by
Ph&oelig;nician traders, touching at the Scilly Islands and
thence sailing to the coasts of Cornwall and Ireland.
From Ireland we have curious relics as witnesses of their
presence&mdash;amongst others, jewellery connected by, or
pendant from, &ldquo;Trichinopoly&rdquo; chains, similar to those
dug out of Etruscan tombs, and which were probably
imported into Ireland as early as the sixth century <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>358]</a></span>
In the Bronze Age the chiefs and the rich men wore
linen or woollen homespun. Fragments of these have
been found in the Scale House barrow at Rylston, in
Yorkshire. Dr. Rock says that an ancient Celtic barrow
was opened not long ago in Yorkshire, in which the body
was wrapped in plaited (not woven) woollen material.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>
Before this time the Cymri in Britain probably wore
plaited grass garments; they also sewed together the
skins of animals with bone needles.</p>

<p>Dyeing and weaving were well understood in Britain
before the advent of the Romans. Hemp and flax,
however, though native to the soil, were not employed by
the early Britons. Linen perhaps came to us first through
the Ph&oelig;nicians, and afterwards through the Celts, and
was naturalized here by the Romans.</p>

<p>Anderson (&ldquo;Scotland in Early Christian Times&rdquo;) gives
a high place to the forms of pagan art which prevailed in
the British Isles, before the Roman civilization; and
differing from and influencing that which came from
Scandinavia. We must certainly allow that it was art,
and that it contained no Greek or other classical element.
His illustrations explain and give great weight to his
theories.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar invaded England forty-five years <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>359]</a></span>
Romans gave us Christianity and the rudiments of civilization,
but their attempts to Romanize us met with little
success. Probably they imported their luxuries, and
removed all they valued at the time of their exodus.
From them we know what they found and what they left in
Britain. Boadicea, Queen of the Iceni, the day of her
defeat wore a tartan dress (polymita) and an &ldquo;embroidered&rdquo;
or &ldquo;fur&rdquo; mantle; probably the fur was inside,
and the skins embroidered outside. Dion Cassius,<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> who
describes Boadicea&rsquo;s motley tunic, says that the bulk of
the people wore what was apparently a chequered tartan.
Semper says that the early tribes of Northern Europe,
like the North American Indians of the present time,
embroidered their fur wraps. The Emperor Honorius,
in the fourth century, made it illegal for Roman nobles
to wear extravagantly-worked fur robes; perhaps the
report of Boadicea&rsquo;s dress had set the fashion in
Rome.</p>

<p>During the first four centuries of our era, all art in
Britain must have come from our Roman masters; and
owing to their neglect of the people they conquered, we
benefited little by their civilization.</p>

<p>All that we know of their decorative art in Britain,
is that it was, with few exceptions, chiefly of small bronze
statues, somewhat crude and colonial, as appears from
the remains of their architecture, sculpture, mosaics, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>360]</a></span>
tombs.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> Of their textiles we have no relics, and hardly
know of any recorded, if we except the works of the
Empress Helena. See p. <a href="#Page_316">316</a>, <i>ante</i>. We must remember
that, as she was a British princess, it is likely
that she had learnt her art at home, and therefore that
the women of England were already embroiderers as early
as the beginning of the fourth century.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>On the departure of the Romans, chaos ensued, till the
Britons, who had called in the Saxons to help them, were
by them driven into Wales, Brittany, and Ireland, which
last they Christianized; and mingled the art of the Germans
and Celts with that of the Danes and Norsemen<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>; all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>361]</a></span>
which may be traced in the Irish remains to be seen in the
College Museum at Dublin and elsewhere. From the
time that England became Anglo-Saxon, literature, law,
and art began to crystallize; and when, under Egbert,
one kingdom was formed out of the heptarchy, order and
a sense of beauty were in the course of development.
Then came the invasion of the Danes (ninth century),
who robbed, destroyed, and arrested all artistic improvement,
till Alfred got rid of them for a time. Early in the
seventh century the women of England had attained great
perfection in needlework. This appears from a passage
in a poem by Adhelme, Bishop of Sherborne. He speaks
of their shuttles, &ldquo;filled not with purple only, but with
various colours, moved here and there among the thick
spreading threads.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> He had himself a robe &ldquo;of a most
delicate thread of purple, adorned with black circles and
peacocks.&rdquo; This may or may not have been woven in
England, but at that time weaving, as well as needlework,
was the delight and occupation of the ladies of the court
and of the cloistered nuns.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> The thralls (slaves or serfs)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>362]</a></span>
were employed in weaving in the houses of the nobles,
probably they embroidered also.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lawrence sees reason to believe that in the
seventh century, silk and fine linen were the materials
for altar decorations, vestments, and dress; whereas the
hangings of the house were of coarse canvas adorned
with embroidery in thick worsted.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> She says the term
&ldquo;broiderie&rdquo; was reserved for the delicate works on fine
grounds, in silk and gold and silver thread, and enrichments
in metal work. Precious stones and pearls had
already been introduced into the Byzantine and Romanesque
designs imported from Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>The English Dominican Friar, Th. Stubbs, writing in
the thirteenth century, describes in his notice of St.
Oswald a chasuble of Anglo-Saxon work, which exactly
resembles that of Aix.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> This is splendidly engraved in
Von Bock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kleinodien&rdquo; amongst the coronation
robes of the Emperors of Germany, and is adorned with
the richest golden orphreys, imitating jewellers&rsquo; work,
enriched with pearls and silver bells.</p>

<p>There is an Icelandic Saga of the thirteenth century
which relates the history of Thorgunna, a woman from
the Hebrides, who was taken to Iceland on the first
settlement of the country by Norway, <small>A.D.</small> 1000. She
employed witchery in her needlework, and her embroidered
hangings were coveted by, and proved fatal to,
many persons after her death, till one of her inheritors
burned them.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>English ecclesiastical art did not necessarily keep to
Christian subjects; for it is recorded that King Wiglaf,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>363]</a></span>
of Mercia, gave to Croyland Abbey his splendid coronation

with scenes from the siege of Troy.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Durham Embroideries, tenth century.</p>

<p>It was probably on account of such derelictions from
orthodox subjects of design that in the eighth century
the Council of Cloveshoe admonished the convents for
their frivolous embroideries.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>In the eighth century our English work in illuminations
and embroideries was finer than that of any Continental
school; and therefore, in view of the great advance of
these secondary arts, we may claim that we were then no
longer outer barbarians, though our only acknowledged
superiority over Continental artists was in the workrooms
of our women and the cells of our religious houses.</p>

<p>During the terrible incursions of the Danes, and the
many troubles that accrued from these barbarous and
idolatrous invaders, the convents and monasteries,
especially those of the order of St. Benedict, kept the
sacred flame of art burning.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Both monks and nuns
wrote, illuminated, painted, and embroidered. They
evidently continued their relations with foreign art, for it
is difficult to say at what period the Norman style began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>364]</a></span>
to be introduced into England. It was the outcome of
the Romanesque, and of this, different phases must
have come to us through the Danes and the Saxons.</p>

<p>I cannot but dwell on the early life and springtide of
our Anglican Christian art, which in many points preceded
and surpassed that of other northern nations, as we arose
from that period commonly called the Dark Ages. Ours
was a gradual development, adding to itself from outer
sources new strength and grace. The better perfection
of details and patterns was succeeded by Anglo-Saxon
ingenuity and refinement in drawing the human figure.
The art, which was native to England, may be judged
by the rare examples that we possess, and of which we
may well be proud; though we must remember with shame
how much was destroyed at the Reformation. Enough
however, remains to prove that our English art of illumination
of the ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries was very
beautiful, and we are not surprised therefore to find in
the embroideries of that period grace and artistic feeling.</p>

<p>The stole and maniple of the Durham cathedral
library, which bear the inscription &ldquo;Aelfled fieri precepit
pio Episcopo Fridestano,&rdquo; are of the most perfect style
of Anglo-Saxon design; and the stitching of the silk
embroidery and of the gold grounding are of the utmost
perfection of needlework art (plates <a href="#pl71">71</a>, <a href="#pl72">72</a>).</p>

<p>The history of this embroidery is carefully elucidated
by Dr. Raine in his &ldquo;Saint Cuthbert.&rdquo; He says that
Frithestan was consecrated bishop in 905, by command
of Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great. Aelfled
was Edward the Second&rsquo;s queen. She ordered and gave
an embroidered stole and maniple to Frithestan. After her
death, and that of Edward, and of the Bishop of Winchester,
Athelstan, then king, made a progress to the north, and
visiting the shrine of St. Cuthbert, at Chester-le-Street, he
bestowed on it many rich gifts, which are solemnly enumerated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>365]</a></span>
in the MSS. Cott. Brit. Mus. Claud. D. iv. fol. 21-6.
Among these are &ldquo;one stole, with a maniple; one girdle,
and two bracelets of gold.&rdquo; That the stole and maniple
are those worked for Frithestan by the command of his
mother-in-law, Aelfled, may fairly be said to be proved.
These embroideries, worked with her name and the
record of her act, were taken from the body of St.
Cuthbert in 1827.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<p>Another and earlier Aelfled was the widow of Brithnod,
a famous Northumbrian chieftain. She gave to the
cathedral of Ely, where his headless body lay buried, a
large cloth, or hanging, on which she had embroidered
the heroic deeds of her husband. She was the ancestress
of a race of embroiderers, and their pedigree will be found
in the <a href="#appendix_x">Appendix</a>.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> At this time a lady of the Queen of

<p>Shortly before the Norman conquest, in the beginning
of the eleventh century, we have notices of sundry other
very remarkable pieces of work.</p>

<p>The Danish Queen Emma, daughter of Richard, Duke
of Normandy, when she was wife to Ethelred the Unready,
and again during her second marriage to Canute,
gave the finest embroideries to various abbeys and
monasteries. Canute, being then a Christian, joined her
in these splendid votive offerings. To Romsey and Croyland
they gave altar-cloths which had been embroidered
by his first queen, Aelgitha,<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> and vestments covered
with golden eagles. She worked one altar-cloth on
shot blood-red and green silk,<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> with golden orphreys at
the side and across the top. When one considers what
the life of poor Queen Emma was, one hopes that &ldquo;Art
the Consoler&rdquo; came to her in the form of her favourite
craft, and that she did find consolation in it.</p>

<p>Croyland Abbey seems to have been most splendidly
endowed by the Anglo-Saxon monarchs. There is continual
mention in the records of those times of offerings
of embroideries and other Church apparels. Queen
Editha, the wife of the Confessor, dispensed beautiful
works from her own workrooms, and herself embroidered
King Edward&rsquo;s coronation mantle.</p>

<p>When in the eleventh century the Normans became
our masters, they found cathedrals, churches, and
palaces which almost vied with their own; likewise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>367]</a></span>
sculptures, illuminated books, embroidered hangings, and
vestments of surpassing beauty.</p>

<p>William of Poitou, Chaplain to William the Conqueror,<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>
relates that the Normans were as much struck on the Conqueror&rsquo;s
return into Normandy with the splendid embroidered
garments of the Saxon nobles, as with the beauty of
the Saxon youth. Queen Matilda, who evidently appreciated
Anglo-Saxon work, left in her will, to the Abbey of
the Holy Trinity, &ldquo;My tunic worked by Alderet&rsquo;s wife, and
the mantle which is in my chamber, to make a cope. Of
my two golden girdles, I give the one which is adorned
with emblems to suspend the lamp before the great altar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I come now to the earliest large work remaining to
us of the period&mdash;the Bayeux tapestry. We must claim
it as English, both on account of the reputed worker, and
the history it commemorates, though the childish style
of which it is a type is indeed inferior in every way to the
beautiful specimens which have been rescued from tombs
in Durham, Worcester, and elsewhere. They seem
hardly to belong to the same period, so weak are the
designs and the composition of the groups. Though
Mr. Rede Fowke gives the Abb&eacute; de la Rue&rsquo;s doubts as
to the accepted period of the Bayeux tapestry, which he
assigns to the Empress Matilda, he yet leans to other
equally good authorities who consider the work as being
coeval with the events it records.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>368]</a></span>
Mr. Collingwood Bruce is of the same opinion, and for
this reason&mdash;the furniture, buildings, &amp;c., are all of the
eleventh century, and our ancestors were no arch&aelig;ologists,
and always drew what they saw around them. Mr.
Bruce fancies the design to be Italian, &ldquo;because of the
energetic action of the figures;&rdquo; this seems hardly justified
when we look at the simple poverty of the style.
Miss A. Strickland suggests that the artist was perhaps
Turold the Dwarf, who has cunningly introduced his effigy
and name. That the tapestry is not found in any catalogue
before 1369, is only a piece of presumptive evidence
against the earlier date, and cannot compete with the
internal evidence in its favour. On 227 feet of canvas-linen,
twenty inches wide, are delineated the events of
English history from the time of Edward the Confessor
to the landing of the Conqueror at Hastings. The
Bayeux tapestry is worked in worsted on linen; the design
is perfectly flat and shadowless. The outlines
are firmly drawn with cords on thickly set stem-stitches.
The surfaces are laid in flat stitch. Though coarsely
worked, there is a certain &ldquo;maestria&rdquo; in the execution.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;orphrey&rdquo; (English for auriphrigium or
Phrygian gold embroidery) is first found in Domesday
Book, where &ldquo;Alvide the maiden&rdquo; receives from Godric
the Sheriff, for her life, half a hide of land, &ldquo;If she might
teach his daughters to make orphreys.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>In the end of the eleventh century, Christina, Abbess of
Markgate, worked a pair of sandals and three mitres of
surpassing beauty, sent through the Abbot of St. Alban&rsquo;s
to Pope Adrian IV., who doubtless valued them the more
because they came from his native England.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

Of the twelfth century (1170) we have the robes and
mitres of Thomas &agrave; Becket at Sens; and another mitre
of the period, white and gold, is in the museum at
Munich, with his martyrdom embroidered on one side,
and that of St. Stephen on the other. The gold needlework
is so perfect that it resembles weaving. It is
recorded that a splendid dress was embroidered in
London for Elinor of Aquitaine, which cost &pound;80, equal
to &pound;1400 of the value of to-day.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>Rock (&ldquo;Church of our Fathers,&rdquo; t. ii. p. 279) truly
says that it is shown by plentiful records and written
documents, from the days of St. Osmond to the time of
Henry VIII., that the materials employed in English
ecclesiastical embroideries were the best that could be
found in our own country or in far-off lands, and the art
bestowed on them was the best we could learn and give.
Various fabrics came from Byzantine or Saracenic looms,
which are described as damasked, rayed, marbled, &amp;c.
The few surviving specimens fully justify the admiration
bestowed on them throughout Christendom.</p>

<p>Matthew Paris, in the reign of Henry III., says that
Innocent III. (1246), seeing certain copes and inful&aelig;
with desirable orphreys, was informed they were English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>370]</a></span>
work. He exclaimed, &ldquo;Surely England is a garden of
delight! In sooth this is a well inexhaustible! And
where there is so much abundance, from thence much
may be extracted!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p>From the Conquest to the Reformation the catalogues
of Church vestments which are to be found in the
libraries of York, Lincoln, and Peterborough, show the
luxury of ecclesiastical decoration. In Lincoln alone
there were upwards of 600 vestments wrought with divers
kinds of needlework, jewellery, and gold, upon &ldquo;Indian
baudichyn,&rdquo; samite, tartarin, velvet, and silk. Even in
reading the dry descriptions of a common inventory, we
are amazed by the lists of &ldquo;orphreys of goodly needlework,&rdquo;
copes embroidered with armorial bearings, and
knights jousting, lions fighting, and amices &ldquo;barred
with amethysts and pearls, &amp;c. &amp;c.&rdquo; The few I
have named will give an idea of the accumulation of
riches in the churches, and the gorgeousness of English
embroideries.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>I have collected from Strutt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Illustrations&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> and
other sources a number of patterns for domestic hangings,
copied from MSS. of contemporary dates, covering
about 400 years, from the time of Harold to Edward
IV. The hangings may have been more effective than
appears at first sight, if the materials were rich and
enlivened with gold. I give two textile designs
which in their style are peculiarly English (plates
<a href="#pl74">74</a>, <a href="#pl75">75</a>).</p>

<p>Now we enter on the age of romance and chivalry,
when all domestic decorations began to assume greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>371]</a></span>
refinement. Carpets from the East covered the rushes
strewn on the floors, and splendid tents were brought
home by crusading knights; and the decorative arts of
northern Europe were once more permeated with Oriental
taste and design.</p>

<p>We know that in the so-called &ldquo;days of chivalry,&rdquo; i.e.
from the Conquest till the beginning of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s
reign, needlework was the occupation of the women left
in their castles, while the men were away fighting for the
cross, for the king, for their liberties, or for booty.</p>

<p>This period included the Crusades, the Wars of the
Roses, wars with France, and rebellions at home; and
yet there was a taste for art, luxury, and show spreading
everywhere.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>The women were expected to provide, with their looms
and their needles, the heraldic surcoats, the scarves and
banners, and the mantles for state occasions.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> They
also worked the hangings for the hall and chapel, and
adorned the altars and the priests&rsquo; vestments. Alas!
time, taste, and the moth have shared in the destruction
of these gauds. The taste for the &ldquo;baroc&rdquo; is a new
acquisition; no one cared for what was old, merely because
it was old. The rich replaced their hangings and
their clothes when they became shabby; the poor let
them go to pieces, and probably burned the old stuff and
the embroideries for the sake of the gold thread, which
was of intrinsic value. But both in prose and poetry we
read descriptions of beautiful works in the loom, or on the
frame, executed by fair ladies for the gallant knights
whose lives and prowess these poems have preserved to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>372]</a></span>
us. I will give one quotation from that of Emare, in
Ritson&rsquo;s collection: &ldquo;Her mantle was wroughte by a
faire Paynim, the Amarayle&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; This occupied
her seven long years. In each corner is depicted a pair
of lovers, &ldquo;Sir Tristram and Iseult&mdash;Sir Amadis and
Ydoine, &amp;c., &amp;c. These pictures were adorned with
precious stones.&rdquo; The figures were portrayed&mdash;</p>

<p>The lady who owns this mantle is herself great in
&ldquo;workes of broderie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the Conquest to the Wars of the Roses, England
may claim to have gradually acquired a higher place in
art. Our architecture, sculpture, manuscripts, and paintings
were not surpassed on the Continent: witness Queen
Eleanor&rsquo;s crosses, and her tomb in Westminster Abbey;
and the portrait of Richard II., surrounded by saints
and angels, at Wilton House,<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> a picture which, preceding
Fra Beato Angelico&rsquo;s works by at least a quarter of a
century, yet suggests his style, refined drawing, and tender
colouring. All who saw the frescoes found in the Chapel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>373]</a></span>
at Eton College when it was restored, will remember
their extreme beauty, and regret that they were effaced,
instead of being preserved and restored. They were a
lesson in what English art was in the end of the thirteenth,
during the fourteenth, and into the beginning of
the fifteenth centuries.</p>

<p>During the Wars of the Roses, when a duke of the
blood-royal is said to have begged his bread in the streets
of the rich Flemish towns, ladies of rank, more fortunate,
were able to earn theirs by the work of their
needle.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p>The monuments of the eleventh and twelfth, thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries, are our best authorities for the
embroideries then worn. The surcoat of the Black Prince
in Canterbury Cathedral is a noteworthy example. The
sculptured effigy on the tomb over which it is suspended
is absolutely clothed in the same surcoat, with the
same accidents of embroidery, as if it had been modelled
from it.</p>

<p>In Worcester, when the arch&aelig;ologists opened King
John&rsquo;s tomb in 1797, they found him in the same dress
and attitude as that portrayed on the recumbent statue.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>
Dress was then extravagantly expensive, and embroidered
dresses were worn with borders richly set with precious
stones and pearls.</p>

<p>The Librate Roll of Henry III. gives us a list of embroiderers&rsquo;
names: Alain de Basinge, Adam de Bakeryne,
John de Colonia, &amp;c.; and in the wardrobe accompts of
Richard II., William Sanstoune and Robert de Ashmede
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>374]</a></span>
are called the &ldquo;Broudatores Domini Regis.&rdquo; These may
have been the artists to whom the orders were delivered,
for in the Librate Roll of Henry III. we find Adam de
Baskeryne receiving 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for a &ldquo;cloth of silk, and fringe,
purchased by our commands to embroider a certain chasuble
which Mabilia of St. Edmunds made for us.&rdquo; There
were certainly then purveyors and masters of the craft.
Stephen Vigner, in the fourteenth century, is so warmly
commended by the Duke of Berri and Auvergne to
Edward III., that Richard II. appointed him his chief
embroiderer, and Henry IV. pensioned him for his skilful
services.</p>

<p>John Garland, in the beginning of the thirteenth
century, is a good authority for the use by our women of
small hand-looms. In these they wove, in flax or silk
(often mixed with gold), the &ldquo;cingul&aelig;&rdquo; or &ldquo;blode-bendes&rdquo;
so often mentioned, supposed to be gifts between friends
for binding the arm, when blood-letting was so much in
fashion that the operation was allowed to assume a
certain air of coquetry. But the idea suggests itself
that this was oftener the gift of the fair weaver to
her favoured lover, to fold round his arm as a scarf in
battle or tourney, to be ready in case it was needed for
binding up a wound, and had possibly served as a snood
to bind her own fair hair. There is an account of a
specimen of this kind of weaving by M. L&eacute;opold Delisle.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>
He describes the attachment of a seal to a grant from
Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion to Richard Hommet and Gille
his wife, preserved in the archives of the Abbey of
Aunai, in the department of Calvados. He considers it
to be either French or English, and says it was a &ldquo;lac
d&rsquo;amour,&rdquo; or &ldquo;tie of love,&rdquo; cut up to serve its present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>375]</a></span>
purpose. It is woven with an inscription in white on a
ground of green, backed with pale blue, and the material
is silk. The woven legend is thus translated from the
old French&mdash;&ldquo;Let him perish who would part us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;opus Anglicanum&rdquo; is first recorded in the
thirteenth century, and is supposed simply to mean
&ldquo;English work.&rdquo; But there is also good authority for its
having been applied, on the Continent especially, to a
particular style of stitchery, of which the Syon cope in the
Kensington Museum is the best preserved great example
known. Its peculiarity consists in its fine split-stitch
being moulded so as to give the effect of a bas-relief; and
this appears to have been generally reserved for the
medallions representing sacred subjects, and especially
employed in modelling the faces and the nude parts of the
figures delineated. The effect of this work has often been
destroyed, as time has frayed and discoloured the parts
that are raised, exhibiting the canvas ground, reversing
the high lights, and causing dark spots in their stead.
This reversal of the intended effect is an additional
practical argument for the flatness of embroidery.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>From the Librate Roll of Henry III. one can form an
estimate of the value of the &ldquo;opus Anglicanum&rdquo; in its
day.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> In 1241 the king gave Peter de Agua Blanca a
mitre so worked, costing &pound;82. This would be, according
to the present value, &pound;230.</p>

<p>The finest specimens of this English work are to be
found on the Continent, or have been returned from it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>376]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
They had either been gifts to popes or bishops before the
Reformation, or they had been sold at that time of general
persecution and pillage. Among the most remarkable
are the pluvial (called) of St. Silvester at Rome, the
Daroca pluvial at Madrid, the great pluvial at Bologna,
and the Syon cope, of which I have already spoken.
The general idea and prevailing design of these three
great works are so singular, and yet so alike, that they
must have issued from the same workshop, and that was
certainly English.</p>

<p>In the Daroca cope the cherubim, with their feet on
wheels, which are peculiar to English design, and the
angels (in the vacant spaces between the framed subjects
from the life of our Lord) have their wings carefully done
in chain split-stitch representing peacocks&rsquo; feathers, of
which the silken eyes are stitched in circles, and then
raised with an iron by pressure, so as to catch a light
and throw a shadow. The ground is entirely English
gold-laid work. This cope, so markedly national in
design and stitches, probably drifted to the Continent at
the time of the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<p>A wonderfully preserved specimen of the &ldquo;opus Anglicanum,&rdquo;
of which a photogravure is here given, was
lately presented by Mr. Franks to the Medi&aelig;val Department
of the British Museum (plate <a href="#pl76">76</a>). In this may be
seen most of the characteristics of this work in the
thirteenth century; such as the angels with peacock
feather wings, moulded by hot irons; the features of all the
figures similarly manipulated; the beautiful gold groundwork,
which in this instance is covered with double-headed
eagles; and lastly, the fashion of the beard on the face of
our Lord and of all the men delineated&mdash;the upper lip
and round the mouth being invariably shaven; whereas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>377]</a></span>
in Continental work, the beard is allowed to grow into
the moustache, closely surrounding the mouth. There
are other peculiarities belonging to English design&mdash;such
as the angels rising between the shrine-work
on the pillars out of a flame or cloud pattern, and the
pillars very often formed of twined stems bearing vine-leaves
or else oak-leaves and acorns. The compartments
which frame the groups, when they are not
placed in niches, are usually variations of the
intersected circle and square. Plate <a href="#pl77">77</a>
shows the cherubim which from the thirteenth
to the sixteenth centuries are found on
English ecclesiastical embroideries&mdash;also the
vase of lilies (emblematic of the Virgin),
and the Gothic flowers which are so commonly <i>parsem&eacute;</i>
over our medi&aelig;val altar frontals and vestments.</p>

<p>It appears that in the reign of Edward III. the people
ingeniously evaded the penalties against the excess of
luxury in dress, by wearing something that looked as gay,
but was less expensive than the forbidden materials; and
which did not come under the letter of the law. They
invented a spurious kind of embroidery which was,
perhaps, partly painted (such examples are recorded).
In the 2nd Henry VI. (1422) it was enacted that all
such work should be forfeited to the king. The accusation
was that &ldquo;divers persons belonging to the craft of
Brouderie make divers works of Brouderie of insufficient
stuffe and unduly wroughte with gold and silver of
Cyprus, and gold of Lucca, and Spanish laton (or tin); and
that they sell these at the fairs of Stereberg, Oxford, and
Salisbury, to the great deceit of our Sovereign Lord and
all his people.&rdquo; In those days any dishonest work or
material was illegal and punishable.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>This was, in fact, a protectionist measure in favour of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>378]</a></span>
the chartered embroiderers, and gave them a slight taste of
the advantages of protection. For a time it was doubtless
useful in keeping up the standard of national work.
Then followed further measures for the benefit of the
established monopolies. First, a statute in 1453 (Henry
VI.), forbidding the importation of foreign embroideries for
five years. This is re-enacted under Edward IV., Richard
III., and Henry VII.; and was partially repealed in the 3rd
and 5th George III. While we are on this subject, we
may remark that in 1707, the importation of embroidery
was forbidden to the East India Company, and we closed
our ports to all manufactured Indian goods. The only
artistic trade <em>now</em> protected is that of the silversmith;
no plate from foreign workshops being permitted to enter
England&mdash;not even do we allow Indian plate to come in,
except under certain conditions. This may be the reason
that our own plate is so very bad in design and execution,
for want of competition and example.</p>

<p>Protection is always more or less fatal to art. The
Wars of the Roses had injured our own best schools, and
we needed refined imported ideas to raise our standard
once again. Perhaps, since embroidery had become a
regular industry, our markets were overstocked by home
productions which were outrivalled by the works from
the Continent, and it was distress that caused the plea for
protection.</p>

<p class="caption">Pall of the Vintners&rsquo; Company (sixteenth century).</p>

<p>It is fair to say that some of the English works of
that time, of which we have specimens, are as good as
possible. In the Dunstable pall, for instance, the figures
of which are perfectly drawn and beautifully executed, the
style is excellent and pure English (plate <a href="#pl78">78</a>). The pall
itself is of Florentine crimson velvet and gold brocade,
with the little loops of gold drawn through the velvet,
showing the loom from whence it came. The white satin
border carries the embroidery. It is a more perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>379]</a></span>
specimen of the later fourteenth century work than the
famous pall of the Fishmongers&rsquo; Company, which shows the
impress of the Flemish taste, which was at its perfection
in the fifteenth. The style reminds us of that of the fine
tapestries from the St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall, Coventry, of which
the subject is King Henry VI. and Cardinal Beaufort
praying. The Vintners&rsquo; Company&rsquo;s pall is also very fine
(plate <a href="#pl79">79</a>).</p>

<p>Of the time of Henry VII. we have the celebrated
cope of Stoneyhurst, woven in Florence, of a gold tissue,
the design raised in crimson velvet. It is without seam,
and the composition which covers the whole surface
is the crown of England lying on the portcullis; and
the Tudor rose fills up the space with a magnificent
scroll. The design is evidently English, as well as
the embroidery, which is, however, much restored<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>
(plate <a href="#pl80">80</a>).</p>

<p>This is one of the &ldquo;whole suite of vestments
and copes of cloth of gold tissue wrought with our
badges of red roses and portcullises, the which we of
late caused to be made at Florence in Italy ... which
our king, Henry VII., in his will bequeathed to God
and St. Peter, and to the Abbot and Prior of our
Monastery at Westminster,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> which were designed for
him by Torrigiano.</p>

<p>From the portraits of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries we can judge of the prevailing taste in dress
embroideries of that period, which consisted mostly of
delicate patterns of gold or silver on the borders of
dresses, and the linen collars and sleeves. Of this style
I give a small sampler, from Lord Middleton&rsquo;s collection.
We have a good many specimens of the work
of these centuries, both ecclesiastical and secular.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>380]</a></span>
They had still a Gothic stamp, which totally disappeared
in the beginning of the
sixteenth century in the
new style of the Renaissance.</p>

Time, Henry VIII.</p>

<p>The next great change
throughout northern
Europe affecting all the
conditions of life, most
especially in England,
was caused by the Reformation,
which swept
away both the art and
the artist of the Gothic
era. The monasteries
which had fostered painting, illumination, and embroidery,
and the arts which had been so passionately devoted
to the Church, were doomed. George Gifford, writing
to Cromwell of the suppression of a religious house
at Woolstrope, in Lincolnshire, after praising that establishment
says, &ldquo;There is not one religious person
there, but what <em>can</em> and <em>doth</em> use either embrotheryng,
wryting bookes with a fayre hand, making garments,
karvynge, &amp;c.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>In the general clearance the churches and shrines were
swept, though never again garnished, and the survivals
have to be painfully sought for, and are so few that a
short catalogue will tell them all.</p>

<p>The greater part of the fine embroideries which escaped
the &ldquo;iconoclastic rage&rdquo; of the Reformation, and the final
sweep of the Puritans, are to be seen now in the houses
and chapels of the old Roman Catholic families, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>381]</a></span>
have either preserved or collected them; also in the
museums of our cathedrals, and spread about the
Continent. For instance, at Sens are the vestments of
Thomas &agrave; Becket, and at Valencia, in Spain, there are
yet in the chapter-house a chasuble and two dalmatics,
brought from London by two merchants of Valencia,
whose names are preserved&mdash;Andrew and Pedro de
Medina. They purchased them at the sale of the Roman
Catholic ornaments of Westminster Abbey in the time
of Henry VIII. They are embroidered in gold, and
represent scenes from the life of our Lord. The background
of one is a representation of the Tower of
London.</p>

<p>In 1520 was held the famous tournament of the Field
of the Cloth of Gold.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> Here came all England&rsquo;s chivalry
surrounding their splendid young king; followed by squires
and men-at-arms, and carrying with them tents, banners,
and hangings covered with devices and mottoes. Their
own dresses, of rich materials and adorned with embroidery
(as well as the housings of their horses), vied in ingenuity
and splendour with those of the still more luxurious court
and following of Francis I., the French king. The tradesmen
and workmen and workwomen in England were driven
crazy in their efforts to carry out the ideas and commands
of their employers. It is recorded that several committed
suicide in their despair. It was worse than the
miseries caused by a Court Drawing-Room now. Ingenuity
in devices was the order of the day. Francis
and his &ldquo;Partners of Challenge&rdquo; illustrated one
sentimental motto throughout the three days&rsquo; tourney.
The first day they were apparelled in purple satin,
&ldquo;broched&rdquo; with gold, and covered with black-ravens&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>382]</a></span>
feathers, buckled into a circle. The first syllable of
&ldquo;corbyn&rdquo; (a raven) is <i>cor</i>, a &ldquo;hart&rdquo; (heart). A feather
in French is <i>pennac</i>. &ldquo;And so it stode.&rdquo; The feather
in a circle was endless, and &ldquo;betokened sothe fastnesse.&rdquo;
Then was the device &ldquo;Hart fastened in pain
endlesse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day the &ldquo;Hardy Kings&rdquo; met armed at all
points. The French king and his followers were arrayed
in purple satin, broched with gold and purple velvet,
embroidered with little rolls of white satin, on which was
written &ldquo;Quando;&rdquo; all the rest was powdered with the
letter L&mdash;&ldquo;Quando Elle&rdquo; (when she). The third day
the motto was laboriously brought to a conclusion.
Francis appeared dressed in purple velvet embroidered
with little white open books; &ldquo;Liber&rdquo; being a book, the
motto on it was, &ldquo;A me.&rdquo; These books were connected
with worked blue chains; thus we have the whole motto:
&ldquo;Hart, fastened in pain endlesse, when she delivereth me
not of bondes.&rdquo; Could painful ingenuity go further? On
the English side we have similar devices. Brandon,
Duke of Suffolk, the bridegroom of the Dowager Queen of
France, Henry&rsquo;s sister, was clothed on one side in cloth
of frise (grey woollen), on which appeared embroidered in
gold the motto,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Cloth of frise, be not too bold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou be match&rsquo;d with cloth of gold.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This parti-coloured garment was on the other side of
gold, with the motto,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Cloth of gold, do not despise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou be match&rsquo;d with cloth of frise.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Besides mottoes, cyphers and monograms were the
fashion, embroidered with heraldic devices. These particulars
we find in Hall&rsquo;s account of the tournament, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>383]</a></span>
detailed description of the golden tent in which the
monarchs met, and which gave its name ever after to the
plain near Guisnes, where the jousts were held. What we
read of its construction recalls the Alexandrian erections,
of which I have spoken already, as well as their hangings
and embroideries.</p>

<p>Incrustations of pearls and precious stones gave a
dazzling brilliancy to the tent, divided into many rooms,
and adapted to the climate of the north. It covered
a space of 328 feet. Hall describes the tent, the
jousts, and the splendid apparel belonging to this last
chapter of the magnificence of chivalry. Brewer remarks
that magnificence was, in those days, often supposed to
be synonymous with magnanimity (at any rate, it was
erected into a royal virtue). &ldquo;The Medi&aelig;val Age,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;had gathered up its departing energies for this last
display of its favourite pastime, henceforth to be consigned
without regret to the mouldering lodges of the past.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>We cannot say how much of French taste was
imported from this meeting of French and English
luxury. The spirit of the Renaissance, fresh from Italy,
was reigning in France, but we had also in Italy our own
emissaries. John of Padua was probably only one of
many Englishmen who travelled to learn and improve
themselves in their special crafts.</p>

<p>Catherine of Aragon introduced the Spanish taste in embroidery,
which was then white or black silk and gold &ldquo;lace
stitches&rdquo; on fine linen (plate <a href="#pl81">81</a>). This went by the name
of &ldquo;Spanish work,&rdquo; and continued to be the fashion down
to and through the reign of Mary Tudor, who remained
faithful to the traditions of her mother&rsquo;s and her grandmother&rsquo;s
work<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> (plate <a href="#pl82">82</a>). Catherine of Aragon had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>384]</a></span>
learned her craft from her mother, Queen Isabella, who
always made her husband&rsquo;s shirts. To make and adorn a
shirt was then an artistic feat, not unworthy of a queen.
Isabella instituted trials of needlework amongst her ladies.
In the days of her disgrace and solitude, Catherine turned
to her embroidery for solace and occupation. She came
forth to meet the Cardinals Wolsey and Campeggio with
a skein of red silk round her neck.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> Taylor, the water
poet, says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">&ldquo;Virtuously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although a queen, her days did pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In working with her needle curiously.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>At Silbergh Castle, in Westmoreland, was a counterpane
and toilet embroidered by Queen Catherine.</p>

<p>Anne of Cleves brought with her the taste for Flemish
and German Renaissance designs; and all the cushion
stitches were in vogue. The Renaissance borders for
dress were mostly worked in gold on coloured silk on the
linen collars and cuffs. Holbein&rsquo;s and other contemporary
portraits illustrate this peculiarity of the costumes of the
time. The women&rsquo;s head-dresses also carried much
fine, beautifully designed, and delicate work.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry VIII. fine hangings were worked
and woven in England; the royal inventories give us
an idea to what extent. Cardinal Wolsey&rsquo;s walls were
covered with splendid embroideries, besides the suites of
tapestries still adorning the hall at Hampton Court. One
room was hung with embroidered cloth of gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>385]</a></span>
Mary Tudor, as I have said, was Spanish in all her
tastes, and we have lists of her &ldquo;smocks&rdquo; all worked in
Spanish stitches, black and gold, or black silk only.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>
This taste, following the political tendencies of the time,
entirely disappeared under Elizabeth. It survives, however,
in peasant dress in the Low Countries.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth spent much of her time in needlework.
She herself had received the education of a
man, as well as her cousin, Lady Jane Grey; and doubtless
many women were taught at that time Greek and
Latin, and to study philosophy, mathematics, and the
science of music, as a training for serious life. Elizabeth
studied and embroidered too; at any rate, she stood
godmother to many pieces of embroidery, which
are to be seen still in the houses she visited or
occupied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>386]</a></span>
While at Ashridge, and afterwards as a prisoner at
Hatfield, she so employed herself; and among the specimens
of work of the sixteenth century exhibited at South
Kensington in 1873, were her shoes and cap, worked in
purl, a semaini&egrave;re in the same stitch, also cushion-covers
in divers cushion stitches, and a portmonnaie in exquisitely
fine satin-stitch; all of which articles, and many
more, were left by her at Ashridge when she was hurried
away in the dead of night to Hatfield.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>The character of the Renaissance of the sixteenth
century, just released from the trammels of Gothic
traditions, was somewhat lawless in England, being
unchastened by the classical element which entirely
controlled the movement in Italy.</p>

<p>The queen&rsquo;s dress soon departed from the severe
simplicity which she at first affected, and every part of
her costume was covered with flowers, fruit, and
symbolical designs; while serpents, crowns, chains, roses,
eyes and ears crowded the surfaces of the fine materials
of her dresses. These symbolical designs were rich
without grace, and ingenious rather than artistic,
although their workmanship was perfect. In Louisa,
Lady Waterford&rsquo;s collection we find a jacket for a
slight girl&rsquo;s figure, of white linen, covered with flowers,
fruit, and berries, all carried out in satin and lace stitches.
There are butterflies with their wings disengaged from
the ground; pods bursting open and showing the round
seeds or peas; caterpillars stuffed and raised; all these
astonish us by their quaint perfection, and shock us by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>387]</a></span>
their naturalistic crudeness of design, and the utter want
of beauty or taste in the whole effect. The impression
left on the mind is, how dear it must have cost the pocket
of the purchaser and the eyes of the workers. There
are, however, exceptions to these defective poor designs;
and in the same collection is a cushion-cover worked in
gold and silver plate, purl and silk, on a red satin ground,
which is as good as possible in every respect, and is
purely English in style. The stitches and materials are
most refined and varied. Purl, which was a newly made
material imported from Italy and Germany, was then in
much vogue, and we have seen a few fine specimens of
it, that have been imitated from the Italian cinque-cento
raised and stuffed needlework, which are very curious and
almost very beautiful,&mdash;only one feels that the same effect
could have been produced by simpler means. This work
is characteristic of the reigns of Henry VIII., Elizabeth,
and James I. We have needlework of another most
unhappy queen of this date. Poor Mary, Queen of Scots,
tried to soften Elizabeth&rsquo;s heart towards her prisoner by
little gifts of her own embroideries.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

the third year of her reign, Oct. 25th, 1561, confirmed
by James II., April 12th, 1686, which is still a London
guild. It received the lions of England as a special favour.
The arms are thus blazoned: &ldquo;Pal&eacute;e of six argent and
azure on a fess gules, between three lions of England
pass. gardant or. Three broches in saltire between
as many trundles (i.e. quills of gold thread), or. Crest:
on a wreath a heart; the holy dove displayed argent,
radiated or. Supporters: two lions or (gutt&eacute;e de sang).
Motto: &lsquo;Omnia Desuper.&rsquo; Hall, 20, Gutter Lane.&rdquo;
There were branches, incorporated and bearing the arms,
at Bristol and Chester, in 1780. (See <a href="#appendix_vi">Appendix</a>.)</p>

<p>In the reign of James I. it was
the fashion to do portraits in
needlework, stitched flat or raised.
Some are artistic in design and
execution, but they are mostly
ridiculously bad.</p>

<p>The East India Company was
founded in 1560, under Elizabeth,
and obtained the monopoly of the
Anglo-Indian trade, under Cromwell,
in 1634. This would have
been the moment for encouraging a fresh importation of
Oriental taste into our degenerate art. Cromwell&rsquo;s own
service of plate was scratched over (&ldquo;graffito&rdquo;) with a
childish and weak semi-Indian, semi-Chinese design;
and we must accept this as typical of the artistic
Oriental knowledge of that day. Grafted on the style
of James I., it shows, however, that Indian ideas were
creeping in and sought for, if not understood in high
places, under the auspices of the East India Company.
Needlework alone was excluded from all benefit. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>389]</a></span>
that date, for 150 years, Indian manufactures were imported,
<em>with the exception of embroidery</em>, which was contraband
by the ancient statutes. This accounts for our
faint and ignorant imitations of Indian work, and the
extreme rarity of the true specimens to be met with in
England, unless of a later period.</p>

<p>But our Aryan instincts have always led our English
tastes towards conventional naturalism. Although we
have lost the rules and traditions which converted natural
objects into patterns, we are continually, in our style,
leaning and groping in their direction, and twining
flowers, those of the field by preference, into semi-conventional
garlands and posies.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, when James I. was king,
protection had done its worst. The style of work called
&ldquo;embroidery on the stamp&rdquo; was then the fashion. This
sort of work in Italy continued to be artistic, but the
English specimens that have survived from this reign are
mostly very ugly. Continental art had ceased to influence
us, and bad taste reigned supreme, except in our architecture,
which had crystallized into a picturesque style of
our own called &ldquo;James I.,&rdquo; and was the outcome of the
last Gothic of Henry VIII. and the Italian style of Edward
VI. and Elizabeth. But the carvings of that phase of
architecture were semi-barbarous. Nothing could have
been poorer than their composition, or coarser than their
execution, and the needlework of the day followed suit.
Infinite trouble and ingenuity were wasted on looking-glass
frames, picture frames, and caskets worked in
purl, gold, and silver. The subjects were ambitious
Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, and James and Anne
of Denmark,<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> and other historical figures were stuffed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>390]</a></span>
with cotton or wool, and raised into high relief; and then
dressed and &ldquo;garnished&rdquo; with pearls; the faces either in
painted satin or fine satin stitch; the hair and wigs
in purl or complicated knotting. Windsor Castle as a
background for King James and King Solomon alike,
pointed the clumsy allegory, and the lion of England
gambolling in the foreground, amid flowers and coats-of-arms,
filled up the composition.</p>

<p>The drawing and design were childish, and show us
how high art can in a century or less slip back into no
art at all. Any one comparing the Dunstable or the
Fishmongers&rsquo; pall with one of the best caskets of this
period would say that the latter should have preceded
the former by centuries. In James I.&rsquo;s time, ignorance of
all rules of composition was added to the absence of any
sort of style.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> I give the illustrations of the time of

The other fashionable work of that day had its merits. It
was the custom to embroider hangings or linen in crewels.
Considering how often in this book and my preceding
lectures I have said that this style of work was common
(even in the early days of Egypt and Assyria), it may
well be said, when was it <em>not</em> the fashion? and I must
answer, &ldquo;only since the days of Queen Anne.&rdquo; It seems
as if before that time our designs for work were partially
influenced by the fine Indian specimens which had
surreptitiously crept into England. Some of these are
very cleverly executed. Huge conventional trees grow
from a green strip of earth carrying every variety of leaf
and flower done in many stitches. The individual leaf
or flower is often very beautiful. On the bank below,
small deer and lions disport themselves, and birds twice
their size perch on the branches (plate <a href="#pl84">84</a>).<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> But even
where the work is finest, the incongruities are too annoying.
The modern excuse for it, &ldquo;that it is quaint,&rdquo;
does not reconcile us to its extravagant effect. To be
quaint in art is, as I have said before, to be funny
without intending it; and these curtains are funny by their
absence of all intention or perspective, and when hung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>392]</a></span>
they make everything in the room look disproportionate to
the unnatural size of the foliage. (Plate <a href="#pl85">85</a>.) Specimens of
this work are to be found in most English country houses.
It has lasted till now, partly because the crewels first
manufactured in the sixteenth century were of an excellent
quality, and secondly, because there was no gold
to make it worth any one&rsquo;s while to destroy them; so the
old hangings went up into the attics in all the disgrace
of shabbiness, and have come down again as family
relics. Even the moths have been deprived of their
prey, by these curtains having served for the beds of the
household, so that they have been kept for their nearly
300 years of existence, aired and dusted. Much of this
work has been recovered from farmhouses and cottages
in tolerable preservation. In many cases the flowers
have survived the stout linen grounds on which they were
worked. The Royal School of Needlework has often
been commissioned to restore and transfer the crewel
trees on to a new backing. The hangings and the
curtains I have described, prevailed from the end of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign to that of Queen Anne, and gradually
deteriorated. The stitches, of which the variety at first
was infinite, had given place to a coarse uniform stem
stitch&mdash;&ldquo;gobble stitch.&rdquo; The materials also were of
inferior quality, and less durable, so that the latest
specimens are in general in the worst condition.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how little the beautiful Continental
work influenced our English school. We were enjoying
perfect protection, and were clumsily taking advantage
of our security from all competition. In the Italian
palaces this was the moment of the finest secular embroideries
in satin stitches, gold and silver, and &ldquo;inlaid&rdquo;
and &ldquo;onlaid&rdquo; appliqu&eacute;s. Likewise in Spain and Portugal
the Oriental work, especially that executed at
Goa, filled the palaces and the convents with gorgeous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>393]</a></span>
hangings, carpets, table-covers, and bed furniture. We
feel it painful to contrast with these our own shortcomings
in art, and our faded glories.</p>

<p>The fact is, that, owing to our art-killing protectionist
laws, embroidery had the misfortune to be treated
at that time as textile manufacture, and not as art at all.</p>

<p>In the reign of William and Mary, Dutch taste had
naturally been brought to the front.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> This included
Japanese art, or imitations of it, and also had something of
late Spanish. The Georges brought into England, and
naturalized a rather heavy work, in gold and silver&mdash;the
design being decidedly a German &ldquo;Louis Quatorze&rdquo;&mdash;richly
stitched and heavily fringed, and much employed
on court dresses and on state furniture. We have seen
royal beds and court suits which show very little difference
in style. It does not appear that this was worked
by ladies. It has, somehow, a professional look.</p>

</div>

<p>Occasionally, however, we meet with pieces of exceptionally
beautiful
work of the end of
the seventeenth
and early part of
the eighteenth centuries.
The style is
the most refined
Louis Quatorze, but
the work is actually
English. The white
satin coverlets belonging
to the Marquis
of Bath and
the Duke of Leeds
are not to be exceeded in delicacy and splendour. The
embroidered dresses of the Duke and Duchess of Buckingham,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>394]</a></span>
in Westminster Abbey (early eighteenth century)
are of this description.</p>

<p>From Queen Anne to George III., a great deal of furniture
was covered with the different cushion stitches,
either in geometrical or kaleidoscope patterns, or else
displaying groups of flowers or figures, quaint and
sometimes pretty. These designs are generally, however,
wanting in grace, and their German feeling shows them
to be the precursors of the Berlin wool patterns.</p>

<p>When the crewel-work hangings ceased to be the
fashion, home work took another direction. All the
ladies imitated Indian dimity patterns, on muslin, in
coloured silks or thread, with the tambour-frame and
needle;<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> but in 1707 the &ldquo;Broiderers&rsquo; Company,&rdquo; we presume,
found that the Indian manufactures were engrossing
the market, and a fresh statute was obtained, forbidding
the importation from India of any wrought
material. This cruel prohibition carried its own punishment.
The Indian trade was ours, and we might have
adapted and assimilated the Indian taste for design.
We might have brought over men and women great in
their most ancient craft, and so produced the most
splendid Indo-English School. The Portuguese at least
sent out their own silks and satins to be worked at Goa;
<em>we</em> threw away our chance, and signed the death-warrant
of our art.</p>

<p>About the middle of the last century, several ladies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>395]</a></span>
notably Miss Linwood, Miss Moritt, of Rokeby, and
Mrs. Delany, copied pictures in worsteds. Some of these
are wonderfully clever and even very pretty, but they are
rather a painful effort of pictorial art under difficulties,
than legitimate embroideries. These pictures would have
served the purpose of decoration better as medallions in
the centres of arabesque panels, than framed and glazed
in imitation of oil paintings. Some of the followers of this
school produced works that are shocking to all artistic sense,
especially as seen now, when the moths have spoiled
them. They can only be classed with such abortive
attempts at decoration as glass cases filled with decayed
stuffed birds, and vases of faded and broken wax flowers.</p>

<p>I may record with praise the efforts of Mrs.
Pawsey,<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> a lady who started a school of needlework
at Aylesbury. She was patronized by Queen Charlotte;
and for her she worked the beautiful bed at Hampton
Court, of purple satin, with wreaths of flowers in crewels
touched up with silk, which look as if they might have
been copied from the flower-pieces of a Dutch master.
The execution is very fine, and reminds one of the best
French work of the same period. Mrs. Pawsey taught
and helped ladies to embroider in silk and chenille, as
well as crewels, and in many country houses we can
recognize specimens of her style; usually on screens
worked in silk and chenille, with bunches of flowers in
vases or baskets, artistically designed.</p>

<p>This was our last attempt at excellence, immediately
followed by the total collapse of our decorative needlework,
and the advent of the Berlin wool patterns.</p>

<h3>POSTSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>A postscript to this chapter will perhaps be acceptable
to those who have taken an interest in the &ldquo;History of
English Embroidery,&rdquo; and who will therefore care to know
about the revival which has filled so many workshops
with what is now called &ldquo;Art Needlework.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a public demand for something better than
the worsted patterns in the trade, and the Royal School
of Art Needlework rose and tried to respond to that call
by stimulating original ideas and designs, and imitating
old ones in conformity with modern requirements. The
difficulties to be overcome were at first very great. The
old stitches had all to be learned and then taught, and
the best methods to be selected; the proper materials had
to be studied and obtained&mdash;sometimes they had to be
manufactured. Lastly, beautiful tints had to be dyed;
avoiding, as much as possible, the gaudy and the
evanescent.</p>

<p>The project of such a school was first conceived in
the autumn of 1872.</p>

<p>Lady Welby, herself an accomplished embroideress,
had the courage to face all the difficulties of such an
undertaking. A small apartment was hired in Sloane
Street, and Mrs. Dolby, who was already an authority on
ecclesiastical work, gave her help. Twenty young ladies
were selected, and several friends joined heartily in
fostering the movement.</p>

<p>H.R.H. the Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein
gave her name as President, and her active co-operation.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>397]</a></span>
The school grew so fast, that for want of space for the
work-frames, it had to remove into a larger house, No. 31,
Sloane Street, and finally in the year 1875 it found its
present home in Exhibition Road, when the Queen became
its Patron. In 1878 the Association was incorporated
under the Board of Trade, with a Managing and a
Finance Committee, and a salaried manager to overlook
the whole concern.</p>

<p>From 100 to 150 ladies at a time have there received
employment. Their claims were poverty, gentle birth, and
sufficient capacity to enable them to support themselves
and be educated to teach others.</p>

<p>Branch schools have been started throughout the
United Kingdom and in America.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p>The education of the school has been much assisted
by the easy access to the fine collections of ancient
embroideries in the Kensington Museum, and by the loan
exhibition of old artistic work, which was there organized
in 1875, at the suggestion of H.R.H. the President; and
since then there have been three very interesting loan
exhibitions in the rooms of the Royal School.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, necessary that the acting members
should avail themselves of every means of instruction, in
order to fit themselves for the task they had undertaken.
They were expected at once to be competent to judge
all old work, to name its style and date, and even sometimes
its market value. They were to be able to repair
and add to all old work; to know and teach every
stitch, ancient and modern; and produce designs for any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>398]</a></span>
period, Gothic, Renaissance, Elizabethan, James I., or
Queen Anne; besides contemporary European work,&mdash;all
different, and each requiring separate study.</p>

<p>Some important works have been produced which will
illustrate what has been said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hang">
<p>1. A suite of window curtains for her Majesty, at
Windsor (style, nineteenth century; sunflowers).</p>

<p>2. Curtains for a drawing-room for the Duchess of
Buccleuch: crimson velvet and gold appliqu&eacute;
(Louis Quatorze).</p>

<p>3. Curtain for Louisa, Lady Ashburton: coloured silk
embroidery on white satin (Venetian, sixteenth
century).</p>

<p>4. Curtain, also for Louisa, Lady Ashburton: brown
velvet and gold appliqu&eacute; (<i>Italian</i>).</p>

<p>5. Dado for the Hon. Mrs. Percy Wyndham: linen
and crewels. Peacocks and vines (<i>Medi&aelig;val</i>).</p>

<p>6. Furnishings and hangings for state bedroom for
Countess Cowper, Panshanger: crimson satin,
embroidered and coloured silks (<i>Chinese</i>).</p>

<p>7. Curtains for music gallery for Mr. Arthur Balfour:
blue silk, appliqu&eacute;, velvet, and gold (<i>Italian</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>The earnest attempt to produce an artistic school of
embroidery met with recognition and help from the
highest authorities. Sir F. Leighton granted permission
for appeals to his judgment. Mr. Burne Jones, Mr.
Morris, Mr. Walter Crane, and Mr. Wade gave original
designs.</p>

<p>We cannot guess whether the taste which has sprung
up again so suddenly will last. Perhaps its catholicity
may prolong its popularity, and something absolutely new
in style may be evolved, which shall revive the credit of
the &ldquo;opus Anglicanum.&rdquo; Of one thing we may be sure&mdash;that
it is inherent in the nature of Englishwomen to employ
their fingers. And the busy as well as the ignorant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>399]</a></span>
need a guide to the principles of design, as well as the
technical details of the art of embroidery. This should be
supplied by the Royal School of Art Needlework, which
by inculcating careful drawing, by reviving old traditions
and criticizing fresh ideas, becomes a guarantee for the
improvement of domestic decorative design.</p>

&ldquo;The people of Babylon, the Accadians, had a written literature
and a civilization superior to that of the conquering Assyrians, who
borrowed their art of writing, and probably their culture, which may
have been the centre and starting-point of the western civilization of
Asia, and therefore the origin of our own. Accadian civilization was
anterior to that of the Ph&oelig;nicians and the Greeks, and is now received
in these later years as the original form, and become again the heritage
of mankind. It has been said that Assyrian art was destitute of
originality, and to that of the Accadians, which they adopted, we ourselves
owe our first customs and ideas. Four thousand years ago
these people possessed a culture which in many of its details resembles
that of our country and time.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Assyrian Life and History,&rdquo; p. 66,

&ldquo;The arts of spinning and the manufacture of linen were introduced
into Europe and drifted into Britain in the Neolithic Age. They
have been preserved with but little variation from that period down to
the present day in certain remote parts of Europe, and have only been
superseded in modern times by the complicated machinery so familiar
to us.... The spindle and distaff are proved by the perforated spindle-whorls,
made of stone, pottery, or bone, commonly met with in Neolithic
habitations or tombs. The thread is proved, by discoveries in the
Swiss lakes, to have been made of flax; and the combs that have been
found for pushing the threads of the warp on the weft show that it was
woven into linen on some sort of loom.&rdquo;&mdash;Boyd Dawkins&rsquo; &ldquo;Early Man
in Britain,&rdquo; p. 275.</p>

I am aware that the presence of the Ph&oelig;nicians (or Carthaginians)
on our coasts has been disputed; but I think that the evidence of the
Etruscan ornaments I have mentioned gives more than probability to
the truth of Pliny&rsquo;s account of the expedition of Himilco from Gades,
500 <small>B.C.</small> By some he is supposed to have been a contemporary of
Hanno, and of the third century <small>B.C.</small> There is some confusion in the
imperfect record of the voyage; but it is difficult to interpret it otherwise
than that he touched at several points north of Gaul. (See Boyd
Dawkins&rsquo; &ldquo;Early Man in Britain,&rdquo; pp. 457-461; see also Perrot and
Chipiez, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Histoire de l&rsquo;Art dans l&rsquo;Antiquit&eacute;,&rdquo; t. iii.; &ldquo;Ph&eacute;nicie et
Cypre,&rdquo; p. 48.) For a contrary opinion, see Elton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Origins of English
History.&rdquo; Elton ascribes the first knowledge of the British islands to
the voyage of Pytheas in the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>; he acknowledges that
the geography of Britain was well known to the Greeks in the time of
Alexander the Great. We owe to Pliny and Strabo the few fragments
from Pytheas that have been rescued from oblivion, and to Pliny the
notices of Himilco. (See Bouillet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dictionnaire d&rsquo;Histoire et de
G&eacute;ographie.&rdquo;)</p>

I give the following amusing tradition, which was probably founded
on the celebrity of the English pearl embroidery of the Anglo-Saxon
times, of which much went to Rome:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then C&aelig;sar, like a conqueror, with a great number of prisoners
sailed into France, and so to Rome, where after his return out of
Brytaine, hee consecrated to Venus a surcote of Brytaine pearles, the
desire whereof partly moved him to invade this country.&rdquo;&mdash;(Stow&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Annales,&rdquo; p. 14, ed. 1634.) Tacitus, in the Agricola 12, says that
British pearls are grey and livid.</p>

These are the poor results of the Roman invasion and neglect of
Britain during their occupation. The second invasion of Britain by
the Romans, under Claudius, was caused by the squabbles between the
chiefs of the different tribes. Comnenus, the prince of the Atrebates,
was at war with the sons of Cunobelinus (Cymbeline). He took his
grievances to Rome, and the Roman legions were despatched to settle
the matter, and to dazzle the world by the echoes rather than the facts
of the triumphant victories in the land of the &ldquo;wintry pole.&rdquo; Claudius
marched with elephants clad in mail, and bearing turrets filled with
slingers and bowmen, accompanied by Belgic pikemen and Batavians
from the islands in the Rhine, <small>A.D.</small> 44. The dress of Claudius on his
return from Britain was purple, with an ivory sceptre and crown of
gold oak leaves. One officer alone was entitled to wear a tunic embroidered
with golden palms, in token of a former victory. The Celts,
the Gauls, the Gaels, the Picts, the Scots, and the Saxons,&mdash;all
crowded and settled in Britain when the Romans left it in 410, after
nearly four hundred years of misgovernment. (See Elton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Origins
of English History,&rdquo; pp. 306-308.)</p>

When St. Augustine (546) came to preach to the Anglo-Saxons, he
had a banner, fastened to a cross, carried before him, on which was
embroidered the image of our Lord. (See Mrs. Lawrence&rsquo;s &ldquo;Woman
in England,&rdquo; pp. 296, 297.) Probably this was Roman work.</p>

An Anglo-Saxon lady named Aedelswitha, living near Whitby, in the
sixth century, collected a number of girls and taught them to produce admirable
embroideries for the benefit of the monastery. (See Rock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Church

Bock speaks of Hrothgar&rsquo;s tapestries, embroidered with gold, of the
thirteenth century. See <a href="#appendix_viii">Appendix 8</a>. But the earliest English tapestry
I have seen is that in York Minster, in which are inwoven the arms
of Scrope, 1390. Wright says of the Anglo-Saxon women, &ldquo;In their
chamber, besides spinning and weaving, the ladies were employed in
needlework and embroidery, and the Saxon ladies were so skilful in this
art, that their works were celebrated on the Continent.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;History of

The Benedictines drained the marshes of Lincolnshire and Somersetshire
to employ the poor in the eighth century. St. Bennet travelled
to France and Italy, and brought back from his seven journeys cunning
artificers in <em>glass</em> and stone, besides costly books and copies of the
Scriptures, in order (as is expressly said by Bede) that the ignorant
might learn from them, as others learned from books. See Mrs.
Jameson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Legends of the Monastic Orders,&rdquo; pp. 56, 57.</p>

Beautifully drawn majestic figures stand in niches on rainbow-coloured
clouds, and the effect is that of an illumination of the
ninth century. The style is rather Greek or Byzantine than Anglo-Saxon.

Queen Matilda was not the originator of the idea that a hero&rsquo;s deeds
might be recorded by his wife&rsquo;s needle. Penelope wove the deeds of
Ulysses on her loom, and it is suggested by Aristarchus that her peplos
served as an historical document for Homer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Iliad.&rdquo; See Rossignol&rsquo;s

the history of Siegfried and his ancestors, and Aelfled that
of the achievements of her husband, Duke Brithnod. The Saga of
Charlemagne is said to have been embroidered on twenty-six ells of
linen, and hung in a church in Iceland.</p>

register of Glastonbury Abbey in the possession of the Marquis of Bath.
It is called the Liber Henrici de Soliaco, and gives an account of the
affairs of that abbey in <small>A.D.</small> 1189 (Richard I.).&rdquo; There was a special
official whose business it was to provide the monastery with church
ornaments generally, and specially with &ldquo;aurifrigium,&rdquo; or gold embroidery,
on vestments. For this a house and land, with an annual
allowance of food, was set apart. Another tenant also held some land,
to which was attached the obligation to find a &ldquo;worker in gold.&rdquo;&mdash;Letter

The reproduction by the Arundel Society of this picture will familiarize
those who care for English art with what is, perhaps, its finest example,
next to the crosses of Queen Eleanor. It has been erroneously attributed
to Van Eyk, but it is undoubtedly English. That its art is contemporary
with the time of Richard II., is shown by the design and motives of
the woven materials and embroidery in which the king and his attendant
saints are clothed. They remind us of the piece of silk in the Kensington
Museum, into which are woven (probably in Sicilian looms) the cognizance
of the King&rsquo;s grandfather, the sun with rays; that of his mother Joan, the
white hart; and his own, his dog Math. This is a good example of the
value of an individual pattern. It helps us to affix dates to other
specimens of similar style.</p>

The merit or blame of this rounded padded work (a caricature of
the raised embroidery of the opus Anglicanum) is often erroneously
awarded to the &ldquo;nuns of Little Gidding.&rdquo; The earliest specimens we
know of this &ldquo;embroidery on the stamp&rdquo; are German. At Coire in the
Grisons, at Zurich (see chapter on <a href="#Page_303">ecclesiastical art</a>), and in the National
Museum at Munich are some very beautiful examples. The Italians also
executed elaborate little pictures in this manner; but I cannot praise it
however refined in execution or beautiful the design. I have seen no
English specimens that are not beneath criticism; they are only funny.</p>

In the Calendar of the State Papers Office (Domestic, Charles I.,
vol. clxix. p. 12), Mrs. H. Senior sues the Earl of Thomond for &pound;200
per annum, her pay for teaching his daughter needlework. Mrs. Hutchinson,
in her Memoir, says she had eight tutors when she was seven
years old, and one of them taught her needlework. This shows how
highly this accomplishment was still considered in the days of Charles I.
and the Commonwealth. Later, Evelyn speaks of the &ldquo;new bed of
Charles II.&rsquo;s queen, the embroidery of which cost &pound;3000&rdquo; (Evelyn&rsquo;s
Memoirs, January 24, 1687). Evelyn says of his own daughter Susanna,
who married William Draper: &ldquo;She had a peculiar talent in designe, as
painting in oil and miniature, and an extraordinary genius for whatever
hands can do with a needle.&rdquo; See Evelyn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memoirs,&rdquo; April 27, 1693;

with a brown stump, broken and worked in chenille, and garlanded

<h2>APPENDICES.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>By Ch. T. Newton.</i></p>

<p>Though the embroidered and richly decorated textile fabrics of the ancients
have perished, all but a few scraps, we may form some idea of the richness
and variety of Greek female attire from the evidence of the inventories of
dedicated articles of dress which have been preserved for us in Greek
inscriptions.</p>

<p>In the Acropolis at Athens have been found a number of fragments of
marble on which are inscribed lists of various female garments dedicated,
for the most part, in the Temple of Artemis Brauronia, in the Archonship of
Lykurgos, <small>B.C.</small> 338-35. These articles were thus carefully registered because
they formed part of the treasures dedicated to the gods of the Acropolis,
which it was the duty of the state to guard, and to commit to the custody of
officers specially selected for that duty. One of these fragments is in the
Elgin Collection at the British Museum, and has been published by Mr.
Hicks in the &ldquo;Collection of Ancient Greek Inscriptions in the British
Museum,&rdquo; Part 1, No 34; and the entire series has since been given to the
world in the &ldquo;Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum&rdquo; of the Academy of Berlin,
ii., Part 2., Nos. 751-65.</p>

<p>The material of these garments seems to have been either linen or fine
woollen; the colours white, purple, or some shade of red, mostly used as
a border or in stripes; or a shade of green, the tint of which is described
as &ldquo;frog colour,&rdquo; saffron, or sea-green.</p>

<p>The borders and patterns noted remind us of those represented on
the garments of figures in vase pictures, such as the embattled border, the
wave pattern, and certain patterns in rectangular compartments. A group
of Dionysos pouring out a libation while a female serves him with wine,
and a row of animals, are also noted among the ornaments.</p>

<p>The inscription, &ldquo;Sacred to Artemis,&rdquo; woven into the fabric of the
garment, occurs twice. Gold, as an ornament fixed on the dress, is mentioned
in these entries. It is noted that some of these dresses served to deck
the statue of the goddess herself. Most of the garments are the <i>chiton</i> or
tunic, flowing to the feet; the <i>chitoniskos</i>, a shorter and more ornamental
garment worn over it; and the mantle, <i>himation</i>. Pieces of cloth or rags are
also mentioned among the entries; these were probably the remnants of cast-off
garments dedicated by their wearers. Some of the dresses are described
as embroidered with the needle.</p>

<p>In the worship of the Artemis Brauronia, certain Athenian girls between
the ages of five and ten were solemnly dedicated to the goddess every five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>401]</a></span>
years. In publishing the inventory in the British Museum already referred
to, Mr. Hicks remarks, &ldquo;It may have been the custom sometimes to dedicate
to the goddess the garments worn by children at their presentation, just as
we know that the garments in which persons had been initiated at the
Greater Eleusinia were worn by them until threadbare, and then dedicated to
some god. If so, the number of children&rsquo;s clothes mentioned in our inventory
is easily explained. Or were these the clothes of children cut off by Artemis
in infancy, such as bereaved mothers nowadays often treasure for years,
having no temple wherein to dedicate them?&rdquo; Mr. Hicks further remarks
that it was usual for the bride before marriage to dedicate her girdle to
Artemis; and at Athens the garments of women who died in childbirth were
likewise in like manner so dedicated. It is probably on account of such
dedications that Artemis was styled Chiton&egrave;&mdash;the goddess of the <i>chiton</i>.</p>

<p>Another list of vestments is preserved in an inscription found at Samos,
and published by Carl Curtius in his &ldquo;Inschriften u. Studien zur Geschichte
von Samos,&rdquo; pp. 17-21. The garments in this list were dedicated to the
goddess Her&egrave; (Juno) in her celebrated temple at Samos. The entries relate
chiefly to articles of female attire, but some few are dedicated to the god
Hermes. Some of these articles were doubtless worn by the deities themselves
on festive occasions, when their statues were decked out. The toilet,
<i>kosmos</i>, of goddesses was superintended by a priestess specially chosen for
that purpose. She was called <i>kosmeteira</i>, or &ldquo;Mistress of the Robes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the Samian list of garments, those which are embroidered or ornamented
with gold are specially noted. Some of the tunics are described as Lydian.
Curtains or hangings are also mentioned in this list. These must have been
used to ornament the interior of the temple, or to screen off the statue of the
goddess on the days when she was withdrawn from the gaze of the profane.
Such hangings were, probably, a main cause of the conflagrations by which
Greek temples were from time to time destroyed in spite of the solidity of
their walls.</p>

<p>In the Castle of Moritzburg, built by Augustus the Strong, Elector of
Saxony and King of Poland, is a quaint apartment, on the walls of which
are hung rugs of feather-work, of which the borders are adorned with set
patterns of fruit and flowers, and the colouring is as soft as a Gobelins
tapestry. The feathers are woven tightly into the warp, in the same manner
as the tufts are set in a velvety carpet; forming a surface as delicate as silk
to the touch. There are four high-backed chairs covered with the same
work in smaller patterns. But what is especially remarkable is an immense
canopy, like that of a state bed, with urn-shaped ornaments of stiff feathers
at the corners; and a pretty bell-shaped fringe of scarlet feathers. The
same ornament edged a large rug like those on the wall, thrown over what
at first appeared to be a bed; but on examination it was found to be a rough
wooden platform, said to be the throne of Montezuma. The story is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>402]</a></span>
Augustus the Strong went to Spain incognito at the age of eighteen, in search
of adventures, and distinguished himself at a bull-fight. When the king
(Charles II.) heard the name of the young hero, he gave him a hospitable
reception, and afterwards sent these Mexican treasures to him as a token of
friendship.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Extract from &ldquo;History of Christian Art.&rdquo; By Lord Lindsay.<br />
Vol. i. pp. 136-139.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;But perhaps the noblest testimony to the revival under the Comneni is
afforded by the designs on the Dalmatic or sacerdotal robe, commonly
styled &lsquo;Di Papa San Leone,&rsquo; preserved in the sacristy of St. Peter&rsquo;s&mdash;said
to have been embroidered at Constantinople for the coronation of Charlemagne
as Emperor of the West, but fixed by German criticism as a production
of the twelfth, or the early part of the thirteenth century. The Emperors
wore it ever after, when serving as deacons at the Pope&rsquo;s altar during
their coronation-mass. You will think little of it at first sight, and lay it
aside as a piece of darned and faded tapestry, yet I would stake on it, alone,
the reputation of Byzantine art. And you must recollect, too, that embroidery
is but a poor substitute for the informing hand and the lightning stroke of
genius.</p>

<p>It is a large robe of stiff brocade, falling in broad and unbroken folds in
front and behind,&mdash;broad and deep enough for the Goliath-like stature and
the Herculean chest of Charlemagne himself. On the breast, the Saviour is
represented in glory, on the back the Transfiguration, and on the two
shoulders Christ administering the Eucharist to the Apostles.</p>

<p>The composition on the breast is an amplification of No. V. (as above
enumerated) of the Personal traditional compositions.&mdash;In the centre of a
golden circle of glory, &lsquo;Jesus Christ, the Resurrection and the Life,&rsquo; robed
in white, with the youthful and beardless face, his eyes directly looking into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>406]</a></span>
yours, sits upon the rainbow, his feet resting on the winged wheels<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> of
Ezekiel, his left hand holding an open book, inscribed with the invitation,
&lsquo;Come, ye blessed of My Father,&rsquo;&mdash;his right raised in benediction. At the
four corners of the circular glory, resting on them, half within it, half without,
float the emblems of the four Evangelists; the Virgin and the Baptist stand
to the right and left of our Saviour, the Baptist without, the Virgin entirely
within the glory, the only figure that is so placed; she is sweet in feature
and graceful in attitude, in her long white robe.</p>

<p>Above Our Saviour&rsquo;s head, and from the top of the golden circle, rises the
Cross, with the crown of thorns suspended upon it, the spear resting on one
side, the reed with the sponge on the other, and the sun and moon looking
down upon it from the sky.</p>

<p>The heavenly host and the company of the blessed form a circle of
adoration around this central glory; angels occupying the upper part,
emperors, patriarchs, monks and nuns the lower; at the extremity, on the
left side, appears Mary Magdalen, in her penitence&mdash;a thin emaciated
figure, imperfectly clothed, and with dishevelled hair.</p>

<p>In the corners, below this grand composition, appear, to the right, St. John the
Baptist, holding the cross, and pointing upwards to Our Saviour; to the left,
Abraham seated, a child on his lap, and resting his hand on another by his side.</p>

<p>The background and scene of the whole composition is of blue, to
represent heaven,&mdash;studded with stars, shaped like the Greek cross.</p>

<p>The Transfiguration, which corresponds to this subject on the back of the
robe, is the traditional composition, only varied by the unusual shape of the
vesica piscis which encloses Our Saviour. The two compositions representing
the Institution of the Eucharist, on the shoulders, are better executed and
more original. In each of them, Our Saviour, a stiff but majestic figure,
stands behind the altar, on which are deposited a chalice and a paten or
basket containing crossed wafers. He gives, in the one case, the cup to
St. Paul, in the other the bread to St. Peter,&mdash;they do not kneel, but bend
reverently to receive it; five other disciples await their turn in each
instance,&mdash;all are standing.</p>

<p>I do not apprehend your being disappointed with the &lsquo;Dalmatica di San
Leone,&rsquo; or your dissenting from my conclusion, that a master, a Michael
Angelo I might almost say, then flourished at Byzantium.</p>

<p>It was in this Dalmatic&mdash;then <i>sem&eacute;e</i> all over with pearls and glittering in
freshness&mdash;that Cola di Rienzi robed himself over his armour in the sacristy
of St. Peter&rsquo;s, and thence ascended to the Palace of the Popes, after the
manner of the C&aelig;sars, with sounding trumpets and his horsemen following
him&mdash;his truncheon in his hand and his crown on his head&mdash;&lsquo;terribile e
fantastico,&rsquo; as his biographer describes him&mdash;to wait upon the legate.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>&rdquo;</p>

In the &lsquo;Manual of Dionysius,&rsquo; recently published by M. Didron (p. 71, &amp;c.), these
winged wheels are interpreted as signifying the order of angels commonly distinguished
as Thrones. Their interpretation as the Covenants of the Law and Gospel, sanctioned

<p>The Hon. and Rev. Ignatius Clifford has permitted me to make
extracts from his &ldquo;Memoranda of some remarkable Specimens of Ancient
Church Embroidery.&rdquo; First on his list is the Cope now in the possession
of Colonel Butler Bowden, of Pleasington, near Blackburn, Lancashire.
I give his account of the mutilated condition, from which he has made his
beautifully drawn restoration. &ldquo;Formerly,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;portions of this cope,
some made up into chasuble, stole, maniple, and some scraps detached, were
at Mount St. Mary&rsquo;s College, Spink Hill, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The well-known architect, the late Augustus Welby Pugin, having seen
them (or at least the chasuble), wrote on the 20th April, 1849, to the Rector
of the College, &ldquo;I found it to be of English work of the time of Edward I.,
and have no hesitation in pronouncing it to be the most interesting and
beautiful specimen of church embroidery I have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other portions of the cope had been made up into an altar-frontal, and
were in the possession of Henry Bowden, Esq., of Southgate House, Derbyshire,
some four or five miles from the college.</p>

<p>The ground is crimson velvet. The designs are wrought in gold, silver,
silk, and seed pearls. The silks are worked in chain, or rather in split
stitch. It contains between seventy and eighty figures.</p>

<p>Only two small fragments remain of the quasi-hood.</p>

<p>In the orphrey are kings, queens, archbishops, and bishops. In the body
of the cope are the Annunciation&mdash;Adoration of the Magi&mdash;Our Lady

<p>Mr. Clifford describes the Steeple Aston Cope. The ground is of a richly
ribbed faded silk. The design worked in gold and silks is enclosed in
quatrefoils of oak and ivy. The Syon Cope he refers to Rock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Textile
Fabrics.&rdquo; See <a href="#appendix_vi">Appendix</a>.</p>

<p>The Dalmatic from Anagni, exhibited at Rome in 1870, he thinks is
probably English.</p>

<p>The Pluvial in the Basilica of St. John Lateran at Rome, he speaks of as
&ldquo;having much the appearance of the celebrated Opus Anglicanum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He describes the subjects embroidered on it thus: &ldquo;No border round the
curved edge. The orphrey is divided into tabernacles containing an archbishop,
two bishops, and three kings and queens. Between the tabernacles
are four angels, each accompanied by one of the evangelistic symbols. The
body of the cope is cut into a most elaborate system of tabernacles, with a
centre compartment of a different form for the group of the Crucifixion.
The subjects are chiefly from the life of our Lord and the Blessed Virgin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>408]</a></span>
The small quasi-hood is embroidered with two wyverns or griffin-like
creatures. The pelican and the ph&oelig;nix are introduced over the top central
group of the enthronement of our Lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Clifford gives the history of the Cope of Pius II. (Bartolomeo
Piccolomini, &ldquo;&AElig;neas Silvius&rdquo;) fifteenth century. It is a masterpiece of
Italian embroidery of the early Renaissance. The material was gold brocade,
covered with wonderful designs carried out in needlework, representing
saints and angels, trees and birds, and arabesques. The whole was adorned
with pearls and precious stones valued at &pound;80,000. At his death the pope
bequeathed this vestment to the cathedral of his native town. The cope
was stolen in March, 1884, from the treasury at Pienza; and shortly afterwards
discovered in the shop of a dealer in antiquities at Florence, but
completely stripped of its precious stones and of some of its more valuable
embroidery. After magisterial investigation, the cope was restored to
Pienza.</p>

<p>The cope at Bologna is thus described: &ldquo;Subjects from the New
Testament contained in two rows of tabernacle compartments, twelve in
lower, seven in upper row. Spandrils occupied by angels playing on various
musical instruments. After each row, a border containing medallions with
heads (of angels, prophets, &amp;c.), twenty-three in lower, nine in upper row.
No orphrey; no border or outside curve; quasi-hood very small.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><i>From Rock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Textiles,&rdquo; p. 275.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Syon Monastery Cope; ground green, with crimson interlacing
barbed quatrefoils, enclosing figure of our Lord, the Blessed Virgin Mary,
the Apostles, with winged cherubim standing on wheels in the intervening
spaces, and the orphreys, morse, and hem wrought with armorial bearings;
the whole done in gold, silver, and various coloured silks. English needlework,
thirteenth century; 9 feet 7 inches by 4 feet 8 inches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This handsome cope, so very remarkable on account of its comparatively
perfect preservation, is one of the most beautiful among the several liturgical
vestments of the olden period anywhere to be now found in Christendom.
If by all lovers of medi&aelig;val antiquity it will be looked upon as so valuable a
specimen of art of its kind and time, for every Englishman it ought to have
a double interest, showing, as it does, such a splendid and instructive
example of the opus &lsquo;Anglicum,&rsquo; or English work, which won itself so wide
a fame, and was so eagerly sought after throughout the whole of Europe
during the Middle Ages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Rock gives a list of the subjects. St. Michael overcoming Satan (from
Rev. xii. 7, 9). The next quatrefoil above this is filled with the Crucifixion.
Here the Blessed Virgin is arrayed in a green tunic, and a golden mantle
lined with vair; her head is kerchiefed, and her uplifted hands sorrowfully
clasped. St. John&mdash;whose dress is all of gold&mdash;is on the left, at the foot of
the cross, upon which the Saviour, wrought all in silver&mdash;a most unusual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>409]</a></span>
thing&mdash;with a cloth of gold wrapped about His loins, is fastened by three
(not four) nails.... In the highest quatrefoil is figured the Redeemer in
glory, crowned as a king, and seated on a cushioned throne. Resting upon
His knee and steadied by His hand is the Mund, or ball representing the
earth.... This is divided into three parts, of which the largest, an upper
horizontal hemicycle, is coloured crimson (now faded to a brownish tint),
but the lower hemicycle is divided vertically in two, of which one portion is
coloured green, and the other white or silvered....</p>

<p>The next two subjects to be described are&mdash;one on the right hand, the
death of the Blessed Virgin Mary; the other, on the left, her burial....</p>

<p>Below the burial we have our Lord in the garden, signified by two trees;
still wearing the crown of thorns; our Lord in His left hand holds the
banner of the Resurrection, and with His right bestows His benediction on
the kneeling Magdalene, who is wimpled, and wears a mantle of green, shot
yellow, over a light purple tunic.</p>

<p>Below, but outside the quatrefoil, is a layman clad in gold, upon his knees,
and holding a long, narrow scroll bearing words which cannot now be
satisfactorily read.</p>

<p>Lowermost of all we see the Apostle St. Philip, with a book in one hand, in
the other the flaying knife.</p>

<p>A little above him St. Peter, with his two keys, one gold, the other
silver; and somewhat under him is St. Andrew with his cross. On the
other side of St. Michael and the Dragon is St. James the Greater&mdash;sometimes
called of Compostella, because he lies buried in that Spanish city&mdash;with
a book in one hand and in the other a staff, and slung from his wrist a
wallet, both emblems of pilgrimage to his shrine in Galicia.... In the next
quatrefoil above is St. Paul with his sword, and over to the right St. Thomas;
still further to the right St. James the Less. Just above is our Saviour, clad
in a golden tunic, and carrying a staff, overcoming the unbelief of St.
Thomas. Upon his knees that Apostle feels, with his right hand held by
the Redeemer, the spear wound in His side.</p>

<p>As at the left side, so here, quite outside the sacred history on the cope,
we have the figure of an individual probably living at the time the vestment
was wrought. The dress of the other shows him to be a layman; by the
shaven crown of his head, this person must have been a cleric of some sort;
but we cannot tell ... for the canvas is worn quite bare, so that we see
nothing now but the lines drawn in black to guide the embroiderer.... This
Churchman holds up another scroll bearing words which can no longer be
read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When this cope was new, it showed, written in tall gold letters more
than an inch high, an inscription now cut up and lost ... the word <i>ne</i>, and
a V on some of the shreds are all that remains of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In its original state it could give us the whole of the twelve Apostles.
Portions can still be seen.... The lower part of the vestment has been
sadly cut away, and reshaped with the fragments; perhaps at that time were
added the present heraldic orphrey, morse, and border, probably fifty years
later than the other portions of this matchless specimen of the far-famed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>410]</a></span>
&lsquo;Opus Anglicum.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Of angels,&rdquo; the &ldquo;nine choirs,&rdquo; and the three great
hierarchies, Cherubim, Seraphim, and Thrones, are figured here. Led a good
way by Ezekiel, but not following that prophet step by step, our medi&aelig;val
draughtsmen found out for themselves a certain angel form. To this they
gave a human shape, that of a comely youth; clothing him with six wings,
with human feet; instead of the body being full of eyes, the wings are often
composed of the bright-eyed feathers of the peacock. On this cope the
eight angels standing upon wheels are so placed that they are everywhere
nearest to those quatrefoils wherein our Lord&rsquo;s Person comes, and may
therefore be taken as representing the upper hierarchy of the angelic host.
The other angels, not upon wheels, no doubt belong to the second hierarchy;
while those that have but one pair of wings (not three) represent the lowest
hierarchy. &ldquo;All, like our Lord, are barefoot. All of them have their hands
lifted in prayer.... For every lover of English heraldry this cope, so
plentifully blazoned with armorial bearings, will have a special value, equal
to that belonging to many an ancient roll of arms.&rdquo; The orphrey, morse
and hem contain the arms of Warwick, Castile and Leon, Ferrars, Geneville
Everard, the badge of the Knights Templars, Clifford, Spencer, Lemisi or
Lindsey, Le Botiler, Sheldon, Monteney of Essex, Champernoun, England,
Tyddeswall, Grandeson, FitzAlan, Hampden, Percy, Chambowe, Ribbesford,
Bygod, Roger de Mortimer, Golbare or Grove, De Bassingburn, with many
others not recognized, and frequent repetitions.... &ldquo;Besides their heraldry,
squares at each corner are wrought with swans and peacocks of curious
interest for every lover of medi&aelig;val symbolism....&rdquo; These coats of arms,
being mostly blazoned on lozenge-shaped shields, suggest that possibly they
record those of the noble ladies who worked the border; while those on
circles may be the arms of religious houses or donors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A word or two upon the needlework; how it was done; and the now
unused mechanical appliance to it after it was wrought, so observable on
this vestment, lending its figures more effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We find that for the human face, all over this cope, the first stitches
were begun in the centre of the cheek, and worked in circular lines, into
which, after the first start, they fell, and were so carried on through the rest
of the flesh tints.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then with a little iron rod, ending in a small bulb slightly heated, were
pressed down those parts of the faces worked in circles, as well as the wide
dimple in the throat. By the hollows thus sunk a play of light and shadow
is brought out that lends to the parts so treated a look of being done in low
relief. Upon the lightly clothed figure of our Lord the same process is
followed, and shows a noteworthy example of the medi&aelig;val knowledge of
external anatomy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must not, however, hide from ourselves that the unequal surfaces,
given by such a use of the hot iron to parts of the work, expose it to the
danger of being worn by friction more than other parts, and soon betray the
damage by their threadbare, dingy look, as is the case in the example just
cited. The method for grounding the quatrefoils is remarkable for being
done in a long zigzag diaper pattern (laid stitch)....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>411]</a></span>
&ldquo;The stitching on the armorial bearings is the same as that now followed
in many trifling things worked in wool (cross stitch).</p>

<p>&ldquo;The canvas (or linen) for every part of this cope is of the finest sort, but
its crimson canvas lining is thick and coarse....</p>

<p>&ldquo;A word or two about the history of this fine cope....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Rock now enters into the history of the guilds, which included noble
laymen and women, and members of the clergy; and tells us that the rolls of
these associations sometimes grew to be exceedingly wealthy. He says that
each of these guilds had usually in its parish church a chapel or altar of its
own, splendidly provided for, to which offerings were spontaneously given
by individuals, or by members clubbing together that their joint gift might be
the more worthy.</p>

<p>Perhaps the cleric and the layman worked on the cope may have been the
donors. Dr. Rock suggests that possibly Coventry may have been the place
of its origin, &ldquo;where the famous Corpus Christi plays&rdquo; (which this cope so
well illustrates) &ldquo;drew crowds every year to see them, as is testified by the
Paston letters. Taking this old city as a centre, with a radius of no great
length, we may draw a circle on the map enclosing Tamworth, tower and
town, Chartley castle, Warwick, Charlcote, and Althorp. The lords of these
broad lands would, in accordance with the religious feelings of those times,
become brothers of the famous Guild of Coventry, and on account of their
high rank find their arms embroidered on the vestments belonging to their
fraternity. That such a pious queen as the gentle Eleanor, wife of Edward
the First, who died 1290, should have in her lifetime become a sister is very
likely, so that we may easily account for the shield&mdash;Castile and Leon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other noble shields may possibly record munificent benefactions.
&ldquo;The whole must have taken very long in the working, and the probability
is that it was embroidered by the nuns of some convent which stood in or
near Coventry....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon the banks of the Thames at Isleworth, near London, Henry V.
built and munificently endowed a monastery, to be called &lsquo;Syon,&rsquo; for the
nuns of St. Bridget&rsquo;s order. Among the earliest friends of this new house
was a Master Thomas Graunt, an official in one of the Ecclesiastical Courts
of the kingdom. In the Syon Nun&rsquo;s Martyrologium&mdash;a valuable MS. lately
bought by the British Museum&mdash;this Churchman is gratefully recorded as the
giver to their convent of several precious ornaments, of which this very cope
seemingly is one. It was the custom for a guild or religious body to bestow
some rich church vestment upon an ecclesiastical advocate who had
befriended it by his pleadings before the tribunal, and thus to convey their
thanks to him with his fee. After such a fashion this cope might easily
have found its way, through Dr. Graunt, from Warwickshire to Middlesex.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign it went with the nuns, as they
wandered in an unbroken body through Flanders, France, and Portugal,
where they halted. About sixty years ago it came back again from Lisbon
to England, and has found a home in the South Kensington Museum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For want of space I have been obliged to omit a great deal of Dr. Rock&rsquo;s
interesting account of the Syon Cope. The reader is referred for further

<p>The Assyrians were great in fringes. Of this we can judge from their
sculptures, in which the rich deep and broad fringe forms the ornament and
accentuates the shaping of the garments of kings and priests and nobles.
Loftus, in his &ldquo;Babylon and Susiana,&rdquo; tells of the only actually existing
remnant of their textile art of which I can find any record. Some terra-cotta
coffins were opened at Warka (the ancient Erech), and in one of them
was a cushion, on which the head, gone to dust, had reposed. It was
covered with linen&mdash;fringed. Nothing else had survived the ages except a
huge wig of false hair. Such fragmentary echoes from a life, a civilization,
and an art dead for thousands of years, are curiously pathetic, and touch
and startle the thinking mind.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Abridged from Trans. by Sir G. Dasent.</i></p>

<p class="center"><small>(<i>From the Ezrbyggja Saga.</i>)</small></p>

<p>In that summer in which Christianity was established by law in Iceland
(<small>A.D.</small> 1000), there came a ship from off the sea out to Snowfellsness, in
Iceland. It was a Dublin ship, and on board it were Irishmen and men
from Sodor and the Hebrides, but few Norsemen.... On board the ship was
a woman from the Hebrides, whose name was Thorgunna. Her shipmates
said that they were sure she had such treasures with her as would be hard
to get in Iceland.</p>

<p>Thurida, the housewife at Frida, was envious and covetous of these
precious goods, and received Thorgunna into her home in hopes, by some
means, to possess herself of them, especially the embroidered hangings of a
bed; but Thorgunna refused to part with them. &ldquo;I will not lie in the
straw for thee, though thou art a fine lady, and thinkest great things of
thyself.&rdquo; Thorgunna made her own terms with Thurida and Master Harold,
and set up her bed at the inner end of their hall. Her richly worked bed-clothes,
her English sheets and silken quilt, and her bed-hangings and
canopy were such &ldquo;that men thought nothing at all like them had ever been
seen.&rdquo; An air of truth is given to the whole story by the details.
Thorgunna is described as &ldquo;tall and strong and very stout. She was
swarthy brown, with eyes set close together; her hair was brown and very
thick. She was well-behaved in daily life, and went to church every
morning before she went to her work.&rdquo; Then comes an account of a storm,
and a rain of blood; and how Thorgunna sickened and died, and at her own
desire was carried to be buried to Skilholt, which she prophesied would one
day be considered holy, and that priests might there sing dirges over her.</p>

<p>There is a curious and picturesque account of the two days&rsquo; journey to
Skilholt, and the adventures that befell the funeral cort&eacute;ge; including the
incident of the corpse cooking the supper of the convoy at an inhospitable
farmhouse where they had sought refuge and received no entertainment.</p>

<p>On Harold&rsquo;s return home after the funeral, he proceeded to carry out the
wishes of Thorgunna, who had warned him that the ownership of her
embroidered hangings would cause trouble, and therefore she had desired
they should be burned. Thurida, however, could not bear to lose them,
and persuaded Harold to spare them. &ldquo;After this followed many signs
and portents, and deaths of men and women, and apparitions of ghosts,
until Kjartan (Thurida&rsquo;s son) brought out all Thorgunna&rsquo;s bed-hangings and
furniture, and burned them in the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are a number of discrepancies between the information in the list of illustrations (LOI) and the
information on the plates themselves. Some of these are simple omission, others involve
conflicting information. The transcriber has resolved and repaired some of these
differences with reference to alternative sources. In general, it seems that the
information on the plate is correct. Those that could not be resolved are as follows:</p>

<div class="amends">
<p>Pl. <a href="#pl05">5</a>&mdash;LOI has "Journal Asiatique, Syro-Egyptien-Ph&oelig;nicien." Plate has "Journal
Asiatique, Coupe de Palestrina."</p>

<p>Pl. <a href="#pl09">9</a>&mdash;LOI has "sixteenth century." Plate has "seventeenth century."</p>

<p>Pl. <a href="#pl10">10</a>&mdash;LOI has "5, 6, 7. Egyptian smooth and rippling wave pattern." Plate has "5, 6, 7.
Egyptian Smooth and Rippling Water Patterns."</p>

<p>Pl. <a href="#pl10">10</a>&mdash;LOI has "10, 11, 14. Babylonian and Chaldean." Plate has "10, 11, 14. Assyrian."</p>

<p>Pl. <a href="#pl11">11</a>&mdash;LOI omits Assyrian references.</p>
